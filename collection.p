VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively, namely AB equal to DE and AC equal to DF, and the angle BAC equal to the angle EDF.I say that the base BC also equals the base EF, the triangle ABC equals the triangle DEF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides, that is, the angle ABC equals the angle DEF, and the angle ACB equals the angle DFE.If the triangle ABC is superposed on the triangle DEF, and if the point A is placed on the point D and the straight line AB on DE, then the point B also coincides with E, because AB equals DE.Again, AB coinciding with DE, the straight line AC also coincides with DF, because the angle BAC equals the angle EDF. Hence the point C also coincides with the point F, because AC again equals DF.But B also coincides with E, hence the base BC coincides with the base EF and equals it.Thus the whole triangle ABC coincides with the whole triangle DEF and equals it.And the remaining angles also coincide with the remaining angles and equal them, the angle ABC equals the angle DEF, and the angle ACB equals the angle DFE.Therefore if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, then they also have the base equal to the base, the triangle equals the triangle, and the remaining angles  equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides.For more discussion of congruence theorems see the note after proposition I.26, the last of the congruence propositions.Euclid frequently refers to one side of a triangle as its \u201cbase,\u201d leaving the other two named \u201csides.\u201d  Any one of the sides might be chosen as the base, but once chosen, it remains the base for the rest of the discussion.  This is simply a linguistic device to save words.It is not  clear what is meant by \u201csuperposing a triangle on a triangle\u201d means.  It has been variously interpreted as actually moving one triangle to cover the other or as simply associating parts of one triangle with parts of the other.  For the two triangles illustrated in the figure, you can actually slide one over the other in a continuous motion within the plane.  Note, however, that if one triangle is the mirror image of the other, then any continuous motion would require moving one triangle outside of the plane.  But the triangles don\u2019t have to be same plane to begin with, and they often are not in the same plane when this proposition is invoked in the books on solid geometry. Whatever the intended meaning of superposition may be, there are no postulates to allow any conclusions based on superposition.One possibility is to add postulates based on a group of transformations of space, or if restricted to plane geometry, on a group of transformations of the plane.  Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) would have said that using group theory is not appropriate to an elementary exposition of Euclidean geometry.  Heath has described a more elementary conservative basis in his commentary on this proposition.Yet another alternative is to simply take this proposition as a postulate, or part of it as a postulate.  For instance, Hilbert in his Foundations of Geometry takes as given that under the hypotheses of this proposition that the remaining angles equal the remaining angles.  Then, Hilbert proves that the base equals the base.Although the two triangles in this proposition appear to be in the same plane, that is not necessary.  In Proposition XI.4 and many others in Book XI this proposition is applied to pairs of triangles in different planes.

VLet ABC be an isosceles triangle having the side AB equal to the side AC, and let the straight lines BD and CE be produced further in a straight line with AB and AC.I say that the angle ABC equals the angle ACB, and the angle CBD equals the angle BCE.Take an arbitrary point F on BD. Cut off AG from AE the greater equal to AF the less, and join the straight lines FC and GB.Since AF equals AG, and AB equals AC, therefore the two sides FA and AC equal the two sides GA and  AB, respectively, and they contain a common angle, the angle FAG.Therefore the base FC equals the base GB, the triangle AFC equals the triangle AGB, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides, that is, the angle ACF equals the angle ABG, and the angle AFC equals the angle AGB.Since the whole AF equals the whole AG, and in these AB equals AC, therefore the remainder BF equals the remainder CG.But FC was also proved equal to GB, therefore the two sides BF and FC equal the two sides CG and GB respectively, and the angle BFC equals the angle CGB, while the base BC is common to them.  Therefore the triangle BFC also equals the triangle CGB, and the remaining angles  equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides.  Therefore the angle FBC equals the angle GCB, and the angle BCF equals the angle CBG.Accordingly, since the whole angle ABG was proved equal to the angle ACF, and in these the angle CBG equals the angle BCF, the remaining angle ABC equals the remaining angle ACB, and they are at the base of the triangle ABC.  But the angle FBC was also proved equal to the angle GCB, and they are under the base.Therefore in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.

VLet ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC equal to the angle ACB.I say that the side AB also equals the side AC.If AB does not equal AC, then one of them is greater.Let AB be greater.  Cut off DB from AB the greater equal to AC the less, and join DC.Since DB equals AC, and BC is common, therefore the two sides DB and BC equal the two sides AC and CB respectively, and the angle DBC equals the angle ACB. Therefore the base DC equals the base AB, and the triangle DBC equals the triangle ACB, the less equals the greater, which is absurd. Therefore AB is not unequal to AC, it therefore equals it. Therefore if in a triangle two angles equal one another, then the sides opposite the equal angles also equal one another.

VIf possible, given two straight lines AC and CB constructed on the straight line AB and meeting at the point C, let two other straight lines AD and DB be constructed on the same straight line AB, on the same side of it, meeting in another point D and equal to the former two respectively, namely each equal to that from the same end, so that AC equals AD which has the same end A, and CB equals DB which has the same end B.Join CD.Since AC equals AD, therefore the angle ACD equals the angle ADC. Therefore the angle ADC is greater than the angle DCB. Therefore the angle CDB is much greater than the angle DCB.Again, since CB equals DB, therefore the angle CDB also equals the angle DCB. But it was also proved much greater than it, which is impossible.Therefore given two straight lines constructed from the ends of a straight line and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed from the ends of the same straight line, and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each equal to that from the same end.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively, namely AB equal to DE and AC equal to DF, and let them have the base BC equal to the base EF.I say that the angle BAC also equals the angle EDF.If the triangle ABC is applied to the triangle DEF, and if the point B is placed on the point E and the straight line BC on EF, then the point C also coincides with F, because BC equals EF.Then, BC coinciding with EF, therefore BA and AC also coincide with ED and DF, for, if the base BC coincides with the base EF, and the sides BA and AC do not coincide with ED and DF but fall beside them as EG and GF, then given two straight lines constructed on a straight line and meeting in a point, there will have been constructed on the same straight line and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same end with it.But they cannot be so constructed.Therefore it is not possible that, if the base BC is applied to the base EF, the sides BA and AC do not coincide with ED and DF. Therefore they coincide, so that the angle BAC coincides with the angle EDF, and equals it.Therefore if two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and also have the base equal to the base, then they also have the angles equal which are contained by the equal straight lines.

VLet the angle BAC be the given rectilinear angle.It is required to bisect it.Take an arbitrary point D on AB. Cut off AE from AC equal to AD, and join DE.  Construct the equilateral triangle DEF on DE, and join AF.I say that the angle BAC is bisected by the straight line AF.Since AD equals AE, and AF is common, therefore the two sides AD and AF equal the two sides EA and AF respectively.And the base DF equals the base EF, therefore the angle DAF equals the angle EAF.Therefore the given rectilinear angle BAC is bisected by the straight line AF.There is an alternate construction where the circles centered at D and E have a different radius, namely, AD, which equals AE.  A different proof is required to show that this alternate construction works.Dividing an angle into an odd number of equal parts is not so easy, in fact, it is impossible to trisect a 60°-angle using Euclidean tools (the Postulates 1 through 3). Euclid\u2019s predecessors employed a variety higher curves for this purpose.  Archimedes, after Euclid, created two constructions: his spiral could divide an angle into any number of parts, and his neusis construction could trisect angles (see the note on I.Post.2). By Pappus\u2019 time it was believed that angle trisection was not possible using Euclidean tools, but that wasn\u2019t proven until 1837 when Wantzel (1814\u20131838) published his proof.Nevertheless, amateur geometers continue to search in vain for such a construction and frequently bother mathematicians with their purported solutions.  Their solutions are of two forms.  Sometimes they simply construct approximate trisections.  Other times they use neusis or some other other tool that goes beyond Euclid\u2019s tools.Students of geometry are cautioned not to waste their time on this problem and, if they do, not to bother others with their purported solutions.  Much better would be to study Galois theory, the mathematics that proves the impossibility of angle trisection.

Make CE equal to CD.  Construct the equilateral triangle FDE on DE, and join CF.I say that the straight line CF has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line AB from C the given point on it.Since CD equals CE, and CF is common, therefore the two sides CD and CF equal the two sides CE and CF respectively, and the base DF equals the base EF. Therefore the angle DCF equals the angle ECF, and they are adjacent angles.But, when a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, therefore each of the angles DCF and FCE is right.Therefore the straight line CF has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line AB from the given point C on it.

Bisect the straight line EG at H, and join the straight lines CG, CH, and CE.I say that CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is not on it.Since GH equals HE, and HC is common, therefore the two sides GH and HC equal the two sides EH and HC respectively, and the base CG equals the base CE. Therefore the angle CHG equals the angle EHC, and they are adjacent angles.But, when a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.Therefore CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is not on it.

VLet any straight line AB standing on the straight line CD make the angles CBA and ABD.I say that either the angles CBA and ABD are two right angles or their sum equals two right angles.Now, if the angle CBA equals the angle ABD, then they are two right angles. But, if not, draw BE from the point B at right angles to CD.  Therefore the angles CBE and EBD are two right angles.Since the angle CBE equals the sum of the two angles CBA and ABE, add the angle EBD to each, therefore the sum of the angles CBE and EBD equals the sum of the three angles CBA, ABE, and EBD.Again, since the angle DBA equals the sum of the two angles DBE and EBA, add the angle ABC to each, therefore  the sum of the angles DBA and ABC equals the sum of the three angles DBE, EBA, and ABC.But the sum of the angles CBE and EBD was also proved equal to the sum of the same three angles, and things which equal the same thing also equal one another, therefore the sum of the angles CBE and EBD also equals the sum of the angles DBA and ABC. But the angles CBE and EBD are two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles DBA and ABC also equals two right angles.Therefore if a straight line stands on a straight line, then it makes either two right angles or angles whose sum equals two right angles.

But the sum of the angles ABC and ABD also equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles CBA and ABE equals the sum of the angles CBA and ABD.Subtract the angle CBA from each.  Then the remaining angle ABE equals the remaining angle ABD, the less equals the greater, which is impossible. Therefore BE is not in a straight line with CB.Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except BD. Therefore CB is in a straight line with BD.Therefore if with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the sum of the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, then the two straight lines are in a straight line with one another.

But the sum of the angles CEA and AED was also proved equal to two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles CEA and AED equals the sum of the angles AED and DEB.

Join BE, andproduce it in a straight line to F.Make EF equal to BE, join FC, and draw AC through to G.Since AE equals EC, and BE equals EF, therefore the two sides AE and EB equal the two sides CE and EF respectively, and the angle AEB equals the angle FEC, for they are vertical angles.  Therefore the base AB equals the base FC, the triangle ABE equals the triangle CFE, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides.  Therefore the angle BAE equals the angle ECF.But the angle ECD is greater than the angle ECF, therefore the angle ACD is greater than the angle BAE.Similarly, if BC is bisected, then the angle BCG, that is, the angle ACD, can also be proved to be greater than the angle ABC.Therefore in any triangle, if one of the sides is produced, then the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

VLet ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC greater than the angle BCA.I say that the side AC is greater than the side AB.If not, either  AC equals AB or it is less than it.Now AC does not equal AB, for then the angle ABC would equal the angle ACB, but it does not.  Therefore AC does not equal AB.Neither is AC less than AB, for then the angle ABC would be less than the angle ACB, but it is not. Therefore AC is not less than AB.And it was proved that it is not equal either.  Therefore AC is greater than AB.Therefore in any triangle the side opposite the greater angle is greater.

VLet ABC be a triangle. I say that in the triangle ABC the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining one, that is, the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC, the sum of AB and BC is greater than AC, and the sum of BC and CA is greater than AB.Draw BA through to the point D, and make DA equal to CA.Join DC.Since DA equals AC, therefore the angle ADC also equals the angle ACD. Therefore the angle BCD is greater than the angle ADC.Since DCB is a triangle having the angle BCD greater than the angle BDC, and the side opposite the greater angle is greater, therefore DB is greater than BC.But DA equals AC, therefore the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC.Similarly we can prove that the sum of AB and BC is also greater than CA, and the sum of BC and CA is greater than AB.Therefore in any triangle the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining one.

VFrom the ends B and C of one of the sides BC of the triangle ABC, let the two straight lines BD and DC be constructed meeting within the triangle.I say that the sum of BD and DC is less than the sum of the remaining two sides of the triangle BA and AC, but BD and DC contain an angle BDC greater than the angle BAC.Draw BD through to E.Since in any triangle the sum of two sides is greater than the remaining one,  therefore, in the triangle ABE, the sum of the two sides AB and AE is greater than BE.Add EC to each.  Then the sum of BA and AC is greater than the sum of BE and EC.Again, since, in the triangle CED, the sum of the two sides CE and ED is greater than CD, add DB to each, therefore the sum of CE and EB is greater than the sum of CD and DB.But the sum of BA and AC was proved greater than the sum of BE and EC, therefore the sum of BA and AC is much greater than the sum of BD and DC.Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, therefore, in the triangle CDE, the exterior angle BDC is greater than the angle CED.For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle ABE the exterior angle CEB is greater than the angle BAC. But the angle BDC was proved greater than the angle CEB, therefore the angle BDC is much greater than the angle BAC.Therefore if from the ends of one of the sides of a triangle two straight lines are constructed meeting within the triangle, then the sum of the straight lines so constructed is less than the sum of the remaining two sides of the triangle, but the constructed straight lines contain a greater angle than the angle contained by the remaining two sides.

VLet the three given straight lines be A, B, and C, and let the sum of any two of these be greater than the remaining one, namely, A plus B greater than C, A plus C greater than B, and  B plus C greater than B.It is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to A, B, and C.Set out a straight line DE, terminated at D but of infinite length in the direction of E. Make DF equal to A, FG equal to B, and GH equal to C.Describe the circle DKL with center F and radius FD. Again, describe the circle KLH with center G and radius GH.  Join KF and KG.I say that the triangle KFG has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to A, B, and C.Since the point F is the center of the circle DKL, therefore FD equals FK.  But FD equals A, therefore KF also equals A.Again, since the point G is the center of the circle LKH, therefore GH equals GK.  But GH equals C, therefore KG also equals C.And FG also equals B, therefore the three straight lines KF, FG, and GK equal the three straight lines A, B, and C.Therefore out of the three straight lines KF, FG, and GK, which equal the three given straight lines A, B, and C, the triangle KFG has been constructed.

Out of three straight lines which equal the three straight lines CD, DE, and CE construct the triangle AFG in such a way that CD equals AF, CE equals AG, and DE equals FG.Since the two sides DC and CE equal the two sides FA and AG respectively, and the base DE equals the base FG, therefore the angle DCE equals the angle FAG.Therefore on the given straight line AB, and at the point A on it, the rectilinear angle FAG has been constructed equal to the given rectilinear angle DCE.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively, so that AB equals DE, and AC equals DF, and let the angle at A be greater than the angle at D.I say that the base BC is greater than the base EF.Since the angle BAC is greater than the angle EDF, construct  the angle EDG equal to the angle BAC at the point D on the straight line DE.  Make DG equal to either of the two straight lines AC or DF.  Join EG and FG.Since AB equals DE, and AC equals DG,  the two sides BA and AC equal the two sides ED and DG, respectively, and the angle BAC equals the angle EDG, therefore the base BC equals the base EG.Again, since DF equals DG, therefore the angle DGF equals the angle DFG. Therefore the angle DFG is greater than the angle EGF.Therefore the angle EFG is much greater than the angle EGF.Since EFG is a triangle having the angle EFG greater than the angle EGF, and side opposite the greater angle is greater, therefore the side EG is also greater than EF.But EG equals BC, therefore BC is also greater than EF.Therefore if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, then they also have the base greater than the base.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two angles ABC and BCA equal to the two angles DEF and EFD respectively, namely the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle BCA to the angle EFD, and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely BC equal to EF.I say that the remaining sides equal the remaining sides respectively, namely AB equals DE and AC equals DF, and the remaining angle equals the remaining angle, namely the angle BAC equals the angle EDF.If AB does not equal DE, then one of them is greater.Let AB be greater.  Make BG equal to DE, and join GC.Since BG equals DE, and BC equals EF, the two sides GB and BC equal the two sides DE and EF respectively, and the angle GBC equals the angle DEF, therefore the base GC equals the base DF, the triangle GBC equals the triangle DEF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles, namely those opposite the equal sides. Therefore the angle GCB equals the angle DFE. But the angle DFE equals the angle ACB by hypothesis. Therefore the angle BCG equals the angle BCA, the less equals the greater, which is impossible.Therefore AB is not unequal to DE, and therefore equals it.But BC also equals EF. Therefore the two sides AB and BC equal the two sides DE and EF respectively, and the angle ABC equals the angle DEF. Therefore the base AC equals the base DF, and the remaining angle BAC equals the remaining angle EDF.Next, let sides opposite equal angles be equal, as AB equals DE.I say again that the remaining sides equal the remaining sides, namely AC equals DF and BC equals EF, and further the remaining angle BAC equals the remaining angle EDF.If BC is unequal to EF, then one of them is greater.Let BC be greater, if possible.  Make BH equal to EF, and join AH.Since BH equals EF, and AB equals DE, the two sides AB and BH equal the two sides DE and EF respectively, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base AH equals the base DF, the triangle ABH equals the triangle DEF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles, namely those opposite the equal sides. Therefore the angle BHA equals the angle EFD.But the angle EFD equals the angle BCA, therefore, in the triangle AHC, the exterior angle BHA equals the interior and opposite angle BCA, which is impossible.Therefore BC is not unequal to EF, and therefore equals it.But AB also equals DE. Therefore the two sides AB and BC equal the two sides DE and EF respectively, and they contain equal angles. Therefore the base AC equals the base DF, the triangle ABC equals the triangle DEF, and the remaining angle BAC equals the remaining angle EDF.Therefore if two triangles have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, or that opposite one of the equal angles, then the remaining sides equal the remaining sides and the remaining angle equals the remaining angle.

And they are alternate, therefore AB is parallel to CD.Next, since the sum of the angles BGH and GHD equals two right angles, and the sum of the angles AGH and BGH also equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles AGH and BGH equals the sum of the angles BGH and GHD.Subtract the angle BGH from each. Therefore the remaining angle AGH equals the remaining angle GHD. And they are alternate, therefore AB is parallel to CD.Therefore if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle on the same side, or the sum of the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles, then the straight lines are parallel to one another.

VLet the straight line EF fall on the parallel straight lines AB and CD.I say that it makes the alternate angles AGH and GHD equal, the exterior angle EGB equal to the interior and opposite angle GHD, and the sum of the interior angles on the same side, namely BGH and GHD, equal to two right angles.If the angle AGH does not equal the angle GHD, then one of them is greater.  Let the angle AGH be greater.Add the angle BGH  to each. Therefore the sum of the angles AGH and BGH is greater than the sum of the angles BGH and GHD.But sum of the angles AGH and BGH equals two right angles.  Therefore the sum of the angles BGH and GHD is less than two right angles.But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet. Therefore AB and CD, if produced indefinitely, will meet. But they do not meet, because they are by hypothesis parallel.Therefore the angle AGH is not unequal to the angle GHD, and therefore equals it.Again, the angle AGH equals the angle EGB. Therefore the angle EGB also equals the angle GHD.Add the angle BGH to each. Therefore the sum of the angles EGB and  BGH equals the sum of the angles BGH and GHD.But the sum of the angles EGB and BGH equals two right angles.  Therefore the sum of the angles BGH and GHD also equals two right angles.Therefore a straight line falling on parallel straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the sum of the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.

VLet each of the straight lines AB and CD be parallel to EF.I say that AB is also parallel to CD.Let the straight line GK fall upon them.Since the straight line GK falls on the parallel straight lines AB and EF, therefore the angle AGK equals the angle GHF.Again, since the straight line GK falls on the parallel straight lines EF and CD, therefore the angle GHF equals the angle GKD.But the angle AGK was also proved equal to the angle GHF. Therefore the angle AGK also equals the angle GKD,  and they are alternate.Therefore AB is parallel to CD.Therefore straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

Construct the angle DAE equal to the angle ADC on the straight line DA and at the point A on it.  Produce the straight line AF in a straight line with EA.Since the straight line AD falling on the two straight lines BC and EF makes the alternate angles EAD and ADC equal to one another, therefore EAF is parallel to BC.Therefore the straight line EAF has been drawn through the given point A parallel to the given straight line BC.

VLet ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to D.I say that the exterior angle ACD equals the sum of the two interior and opposite angles CAB and ABC, and the sum of the three interior angles of the triangle ABC, BCA, and CAB equals two right angles.Draw CE through the point C parallel to the straight line AB.Since AB is parallel to CE, and AC falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles BAC and ACE equal one another.Again, since AB is parallel to CE, and the straight line BD falls upon them, therefore the exterior angle ECD equals the interior and opposite angle ABC.But the angle ACE was also proved equal to the angle BAC. Therefore the whole angle ACD equals the sum of the two interior and opposite angles BAC and ABC.Add the angle ACB to each. Then the sum of the angles ACD and ACB equals the sum of the three angles ABC, BCA,  and CAB.But the sum of the angles ACD and ACB equals two right angles. Therefore the sum of the angles ABC, BCA, and CAB also equals two right angles.Therefore in any triangle, if one of the sides is produced, then the exterior angle equals the sum of the two interior and opposite angles, and the sum of the three interior angles of the triangle equals two right angles.

Therefore the angle ACB equals the angle CBD.Since the straight line BC falling on the two straight lines AC and BD makes the alternate angles equal to one another, therefore AC is parallel to BD.And it was also proved equal to it.Therefore straight lines which join the ends of equal and parallel straight lines in the same directions are themselves equal and parallel.

VLet ACDB be a parallelogrammic area, and BC its diameter.I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram ACDB equal one another, and the diameter BC bisects it.Since AB is parallel to CD, and the straight line BC falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles ABC and BCD equal one another.Again, since AC is parallel to BD, and BC falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles ACB and CBD equal one another.Therefore ABC and DCB are two triangles having the two angles ABC and BCA equal to the two angles DCB and CBD respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, BC. Therefore they also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle. Therefore the side AB equals CD, and AC equals BD, and further the angle BAC equals the angle CDB.Since the angle ABC equals the angle BCD, and the angle CBD equals the angle ACB, therefore the whole angle ABD equals the whole angle ACD.And the angle BAC was also proved equal to the angle CDB.Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another.I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.Since AB equals CD, and BC is common, the two sides AB and BC equal the two sides DC and CB respectively, and the angle ABC equals the angle BCD. Therefore the base AC also equals DB, and the triangle ABC equals the triangle DCB.Therefore the diameter BC bisects the parallelogram ACDB.Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.

VLet ABCD and EBCF be parallelograms on the same base BC and in the same parallels AF and BC.I say that ABCD equals the parallelogram EBCF.Since ABCD is a parallelogram, therefore AD equals BC.For the same reason EF equals BC, so that AD also equals EF. And DE is common, therefore the whole AE equals the whole DF.But AB also equals DC. Therefore the two sides EA and AB equal the two sides FD and DC respectively, and the angle FDC equals the angle EAB, the exterior equals the interior. Therefore the base EB equals the base FC, and the triangle EAB equals the triangle FDC.Subtract DGE from each. Then the trapezium ABGD which remains equals the trapezium EGCF which remains.Add the triangle GBC to each. Then the whole parallelogram ABCD equals the whole parallelogram EBCF.Therefore parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels equal one another.

VLet ABC be the given triangle, and D the given rectilinear angle.It is required to construct in D a parallelogram equal to the triangle ABC in the rectilinear angle.Bisect BC at E, and join AE. Construct the angle CEF on the straight line EC at the point E on it equal to the angle D. Draw AG through A parallel to EC, and draw CG through C parallel to EF.Then FECG is a parallelogram.Since BE equals EC, therefore the triangle ABE also equals the triangle AEC, for they are on equal bases BE and EC and in the same parallels BC and AG. Therefore the triangle ABC is double the triangle AEC.But the parallelogram FECG is also double the triangle AEC, for it has the same base with it and is in the same parallels with it, therefore the parallelogram FECG equals the triangle ABC.And it has the angle CEF equal to the given angle D.Therefore the parallelogram FECG has been constructed equal to the given triangle ABC, in the angle CEF which equals D.

VLet ABCD be a parallelogram, and AC its diameter, and about AC let EH and FG be parallelograms, and BK and KD the so-called complements.I say that the complement BK equals the complement KD.Since ABCD is a parallelogram, and AC its diameter, therefore the triangle ABC equals the triangle ACD.Again, since EH is a parallelogram, and AK is its diameter, therefore the triangle AEK equals the triangle AHK. For the same reason the triangle KFC also equals KGC.Now, since the triangle AEK equals the triangle AHK, and KFC equals KGC, therefore the triangle AEK together with KGC equals the triangle AHK together with KFC.And the whole triangle ABC also equals the whole ADC, therefore the remaining complement BK equals the remaining complement KD.Therefore in any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter equal one another.

VLet AB be the given straight line, D the given rectilinear angle, and C the given triangle.It is required to apply a parallelogram equal to the given triangle C to the given straight line AB in an angle equal to D.Construct the parallelogram BEFG equal to the triangle C in the angle EBG which equals D, and let it be placed so that BE is in a straight line with AB.Draw FG through to H, and draw AH through A parallel to either BG or EF. Join HB.Since the straight line HF falls upon the parallels AH and EF, therefore the sum of the angles AHF and HFE equals two right angles. Therefore the sum of the angles BHG and GFE is less than two right angles. And straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet, therefore HB and FE, when produced, will meet.Let them be produced and meet at K. Draw KL through the point K parallel to either EA or FH.  Produce HA and GB to the points L and M.Then HLKF is a parallelogram, HK is its diameter, and AG and ME are parallelograms, and LB and BF are the so-called complements about HK.  Therefore LB equals BF.But BF equals the triangle C, therefore LB also equals C.Since the angle GBE equals the angle ABM, while the angle GBE equals D, therefore the angle ABM also equals the angle D.Therefore the parallelogram LB equal to the given triangle C has been applied to the given straight line AB, in the angle ABM which equals D.

VLet ABCD be the given rectilinear figure and E the given rectilinear angle.It is required to construct a parallelogram equal to the rectilinear figure ABCD in the given angle E.Join DB.  Construct the parallelogram FH equal to the triangle ABD  in the angle HKF which equals E.  Apply the parallelogram GM equal to the triangle DBC to the straight line GH in the angle GHM which equals E.Since the angle E equals each of the angles HKF and GHM, therefore the angle HKF also equals the angle GHM.Add the angle KHG to each. Therefore the sum of the angles FKH and KHG equals the sum of the angles KHG and GHM.But the sum of the angles FKH and KHG equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles KHG and GHM also equals  two right angles.Thus, with a straight line GH, and at the point H on it, two straight lines KH and HM not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles together equal to two right angles, therefore KH is in a straight line with HM.Since the straight line HG falls upon the parallels KM and FG, therefore the alternate angles MHG and HGF equal one another.Add the angle HGL to each. Then the sum of the angles MHG and HGL equals the sum of the angles HGF and HGL.But the sum of the angles MHG and HGL equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles HGF and HGL also equals two right angles.  Therefore FG is in a straight line with GL.Since FK is equal and parallel to HG, and HG equal and parallel to ML also, therefore KF is also equal and parallel to ML, and the straight lines KM and FL join them at their ends. Therefore KM and FL are also equal and parallel.  Therefore KFLM is a parallelogram.Since the triangle ABD equals the parallelogram FH, and DBC equals GM, therefore the whole rectilinear figure ABCD equals the whole parallelogram KFLM.Therefore the parallelogram KFLM has been constructed equal to the given rectilinear figure ABCD in the angle FKM which equals the given angle E.

Draw DE through the point D parallel to AB, and draw BE through the point B parallel to AD.Then ADEB is a parallelogram. Therefore AB equals DE, and AD equals BE.But AB equals AD, therefore the four straight lines BA, AD, DE, and EB equal one another. Therefore the parallelogram ADEB is equilateral.I say next that it is also right-angled.Since the straight line AD falls upon the parallels AB and DE, therefore the sum of the angles BAD and ADE equals two right angles.But the angle BAD is right, therefore the angle ADE is also right.And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another, therefore each of the opposite angles ABE and BED is also right. Therefore ADEB is right-angled.And it was also proved equilateral.Therefore it is a square, and it is described on the straight line AB.

VLet ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle BAC right.I say that the square on BC equals the sum of the squares on BA and AC.Describe the square BDEC on BC, and the squares GB and HC on BA and AC.  Draw AL through A parallel to either BD or CE, and join AD and FC.Since each of the angles BAC and BAG is right, it follows that with a straight line BA, and at the point A on it, the two straight lines AC and AG not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, therefore CA is in a straight line with AG.For the same reason BA is also in a straight line with AH.Since the angle DBC equals the angle FBA, for each is right, add the angle ABC  to each, therefore the whole angle DBA equals the whole angle FBC.Since DB equals BC, and FB equals BA, the two sides AB and BD equal the two sides FB and BC respectively, and the angle ABD equals the angle FBC, therefore the base AD equals the base FC, and the triangle ABD equals the triangle FBC.Now the parallelogram BL is double the triangle ABD, for they have the same base BD and are in the same parallels BD and AL.  And the square GB is double the triangle FBC, for they again have the same base FB and are in the same parallels FB and GC.Therefore the parallelogram BL also equals the square GB.Similarly, if AE and BK are joined, the parallelogram CL can also be proved equal to the square HC.  Therefore the whole square BDEC equals the sum of the two squares GB and HC.And the square BDEC is described on BC, and the squares GB and HC on BA and AC.Therefore the square on BC equals the sum of the squares on BA and AC.Therefore in right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle..

VIn the triangle ABC let the square on one side BC equal the sum of the squares on the sides BA and ACI say that the angle BAC is right.Draw AD from the point A at right angles to the straight line AC.  Make AD equal to BA, and join DC.Since DA equals AB, therefore the square on DA also equals the square on AB.Add the square on AC to each. Then the sum of the squares on DA and AC equals the sum of the squares on BA and AC.But the square on DC equals the sum of the squares on DA and AC, for the angle DAC is right, and the square on BC equals the sum of the squares on BA and AC, for this is the hypothesis, therefore the square on DC equals the square on BC, so that the side DC also equals BC.Since DA equals AB, and AC is common, the two sides DA and AC equal the two sides BA and AC, and the base DC equals the base BC, therefore the angle DAC equals the angle BAC. But the angle DAC is right, therefore the angle BAC is also right.Therefore if in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.

Similarly also EH is the rectangle A by EC.Therefore the rectangle A by BC equals the sum of the rectangle A by BD, the rectangle A by DE, and the rectangle A by EC.Therefore if there are two straight lines, and one of them is cut into any number of segments whatever, then the rectangle contained by the two straight lines equals the sum of the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments.

VLet the straight line AB be cut at random at C.I say that the square on AB equals the sum of the squares on AC and CB plus twice the rectangle AC by CB.Describe the square ADEB on AB. Join BD. Draw CF through C parallel to either AD or EB, and draw HK through G parallel to either AB or DE.Then, since CF is parallel to AD, and BD falls on them, the exterior angle CGB equals the interior and opposite angle ADB.But the angle ADB equals the angle ABD, since the side BA also equals AD. Therefore the angle CGB also equals the angle GBC, so that the side BC also equals the side CG.But CB equals GK, and CG to KB. Therefore GK also equals KB. Therefore CGKB is equilateral.I say next that it is also right-angled.Since CG is parallel to BK, the sum of the angles KBC and GCB equals two right angles.But the angle KBC is right. Therefore the angle BCG is also right, so that the opposite angles CGK and GKB are also right.Therefore CGKB is right-angled, and it was also proved equilateral, therefore it is a square, and it is described on CB.For the same reason HF is also a square, and it is described on HG, that is AC.  Therefore the squares HF and KC are the squares on AC and CB.Now, since AG equals GE, and AG is the rectangle AC by CB, for GC equals CB, therefore GE also equals the rectangle AC by CB.  Therefore the sum of AG and GE equals twice the rectangle AC by CB.But the squares HF and CK are also the squares on AC and CB, therefore the sum of the four figures HF, CK, AG, and GE equals the sum of the squares on AC and CB plus twice the rectangle AC by CB.But HF, CK, AG, and GE are the whole ADEB, which is the square on AB.Therefore the square on AB equals the the sum of the squares on AC and CB plus twice the rectangle AC by CB.Therefore if a straight line is cut at random, the square on the whole equals the squares on the segments plus twice the rectangle contained by the segments.

VLet a straight line AB be cut into equal segments at C and into unequal segments at D.I say that the rectangle  AD by DB together with the square on CD equals the square on CB.Describe the square CEFB on CB, and join BE.  Draw DG through D parallel to either CE or BF, again draw KM through H parallel to either AB or EF, and again draw AK through A parallel to either CL or BM.Then, since the complement CH equals the complement HF, add DM to each. Therefore the whole CM equals the whole DF.But CM equals AL, since AC is also equal to CB. Therefore AL also equals DF. Add CH to each. Therefore the whole AH equals the gnomon NOP.But AH is the rectangle AD by DB, for DH equals DB, therefore the gnomon NOP also equals the rectangle AD by DB.Add LG, which equals the square on CD, to each. Therefore the sum of the gnomon NOP and LG equals the sum of the rectangle AD by DB and the square on CD.But the gnomon NOP together with LG is the whole square CEFB, which is described on CB.Therefore the rectangle  AD by DB together with the square on CD equals the square on CB.Therefore if a straight line is cut into equal and unequal segments, then the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section equals the square on the half.

VLet a straight line AB be bisected at the point C, and let a straight line BD be added to it in a straight line.I say that the rectangle AD by DB together with the square on CB equals the square on CD.Describe the square CEFD on CD, and join DE.  Draw BG through the point B parallel to either EC or DF, draw KM through the point H parallel to either AB or EF, and further draw AK through A parallel to either CL or DM.Then, since AC equals CB, AL also equals CH.  But CH equals HF. Therefore AL also equals HF.Add CM to each.  Therefore the whole AM equals the gnomon NOP.But AM is the rectangle AD by DB, for DM equals DB.  Therefore the gnomon NOP also equals the rectangle AD by DB.Add LG, which equals the square on BC, to each. Therefore the rectangle AD by DB together with the square on CB equals the gnomon NOP plus LG.But the gnomon NOP and LG are the whole square CEFD, which is described on CD.Therefore the rectangle AD by DB together with the square on CB equals the square on CD.Therefore if a straight line is bisected and a straight line is added to it in a straight line, then the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half equals the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line.

VLet a straight line AB be cut at random at the point C.I say that the sum of the squares on AB and BC equals twice the rectangle AB by BC plus the square on CA.Describe the square ADEB on AB, and let the figure be drawn.Then, since AG equals GE, add CF to each, therefore the whole AF equals the whole CE.Therefore the sum of AF and CE is double AF.But the sum of AF and CE equals the gnomon KLM plus the square CF, therefore the gnomon KLM plus the square CF is double AF.But twice the rectangle AB by BC is also double  AF, for BF equals BC, therefore the gnomon KLM plus the square CF equal twice the rectangle AB by BC.Add DG, which is the square on AC, to each. Therefore the gnomon KLM plus the sum of the squares BG and GD equals twice the rectangle AB by BC plus the square on AC.But the gnomon KLM plus the sum of the squares BG and GD equals the whole ADEB plus CF, which are squares described on AB and BC.Therefore the sum of the squares on AB and BC equals twice the rectangle AB by BC plus the square on CA.Therefore if a straight line is cut at random, then the sum of the square on the whole and that on one of the segments equals twice the rectangle contained by the whole and the said segment plus the square on the remaining segment.

VLet a straight line AB be cut at random at the point C.I say that four times the rectangle AB by BC plus the square on AC equals the square described on AB and BC as on one straight line.Produce the straight line BD in a straight line with AB, and make BD equal to CB. Describe the square AEFD on AD, and let the figure be drawn.Then, since CB equals BD, while CB equals GK, and BD equals KN, therefore GK also equals KN.For the same reason QR also equals RP.And, since BC equals BD, and GK equals KN, therefore CK also equals KD, and GR equals RN.But CK equals RN, for they are complements of the parallelogram CP. Therefore KD also equals GR.  Therefore the four areas DK, CK, GR, RN equal one another. Therefore the four are quadruple of CK.Again, since CB equals BD, while BD equals BK, that is CG, and CB equals GK, that is GQ, therefore CG also equals GQ.And, since CG equals GQ, and QR equals RP, AG also equals MQ, and QL equals RF.But MQ equals QL, for they are complements of the parallelogram ML, therefore AG also equals RF.  Therefore the four areas AG, MQ, QL, RF equal one another. Therefore the four are quadruple of AG. But the four areas CK, KD, GR, RN were proved to be quadruple of CK, therefore the eight areas, which contain the gnomon STU, are quadruple of AK.Now, since AK is the rectangle AB by BD, for BK equals BD, therefore four times the rectangle AB by BD is quadruple of AK.But the gnomon STU was also proved to be quadruple of AK, therefore four times the rectangle AB by BD equals the gnomon STU.Add OH, which equals the square on AC, to each.  Therefore four times the rectangle AB by BD plus the square on AC equals the gnomon STU plus OH.But the gnomon STU and OH are the whole square AEFD, which is described on AD. Therefore four times the rectangle AB by BD plus the square on AC equals the square on AD.But BD equals BC.Therefore four times the rectangle AB by BC together with the square on AC equals the square on AD, that is to the square described on AB and BC as on one straight line.Therefore if a straight line is cut at random, then four times the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments plus the square on the remaining segment equals the square described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one straight line.

VLet a straight line AB be cut into equal segments at C, and into unequal segments at D.I say that the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.Draw CE from C at right angles to AB, and make it equal to either AC or CB. Join EA and EB. Draw DF through D parallel to EC and FG through F parallel to AB. Join AF.Then, since AC equals CE, the angle EAC also equals the angle AEC.And, since the angle at C is right, the sum of the remaining angles EAC and AEC equals one right angle.And they are equal, therefore each of the angles CEA and CAE is half of a right angle.For the same reason each of the angles CEB and EBC is also half of a right angle, therefore the whole angle AEB is right.And, since the angle GEF is half of a right angle, and the angle EGF is right, for it equals the interior and opposite angle ECB, the remaining angle EFG is half of a right angle.  Therefore the angle GEF equals the angle EFG, so that the side EG also equals GF.Again, since the angle at B is half of a right angle, and the angle FDB is right, for it is again equal to the interior and opposite angle ECB, the remaining angle BFD is half of a right angle.  Therefore the angle at B equals the angle DFB, so that the side FD also equals the side DB.Now, since AC equals CE, the square on AC also equals the square on CE, therefore the sum of the squares on AC and CE is double the square on AC.But the square on EA equals the sum of the squares on AC and CE, for the angle ACE is right, therefore the square on EA is double the square on AC.Again, since EG equals GF, the square on EG also equals the square on GF.  Therefore the sum of the squares on EG and GF is double the square on GF.But the square on EF equals the sum of the squares on EG and GF, therefore the square on EF is double the square on GF.But GF equals CD, therefore the square on EF is double the square on CD.But the square on EA is also double of the square on AC, therefore the sum of the squares on AE and EF is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.And the square on AF equals sum of the squares on AE and EF, for the angle AEF is right.  Therefore the square on AF is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.But the sum of the squares on AD and DF equals the square on AF, for the angle at D is right, therefore the sum of the squares on AD and DF is double the sum the squares on AC and CD.And DF equals DB.Therefore the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.Therefore if a straight line is cut into equal and unequal segments, then the sum of the squares on the unequal segments of the whole is double the sum of the square on the half and the square on the straight line between the points of section.

VLet a straight line AB be bisected at C, and let a straight line BD be added to it in a straight line.I say that the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.Draw CE from the point C at right angles to AB and equal to either AC or CB.  Join EA and EB.  Draw EF through E parallel to AD, and draw FD through D parallel to CE.Then, since a straight line EF falls on the parallel straight lines EC and FD, the sum of the angles CEF and EFD  equals two right angles.  Therefore the sum of the angles FEB and EFD is less than two right angles.But straight lines produced from angles less than two right angles meet. Therefore EB and FD, if produced in the direction B and D, will meet.Let them be produced and meet at G, and join AG.Then, since AC equals CE, the angle EAC also equals the angle AEC. The angle at C is right, therefore each of the angles EAC and AEC is half of a right angle.For the same reason each of the angles CEB and EBC is also half of a right angle, therefore the angle AEB is right.And, since the angle EBC is half of a right angle, the angle DBG is also half of a right angle.  But the angle BDG is also right, for it equals the angle DCE, since they are alternate.  Therefore the remaining angle DGB is half of a right angle. Therefore the angle DGB equals the angle DBG, so that the side BD also equals the side GD.Again, since the angle EGF is half of a right angle, and the angle at F is right, for it equals the opposite angle, the angle at C,  the remaining angle FEG is half of a right angle. Therefore the angle EGF equals the angle FEG, so that the side GF also equals the side EF.Now, since the square on EC equals the square on CA, the sum of the squares on EC and CA is double the square on CA.  But the square on EA equals the sum of the squares on EC and CA, therefore the square on EA is double the square on AC.Again, since FG equals EF, the square on FG also equals the square on FE.  Therefore the sum of the squares on GF and FE is double the square on EF.  But the square on EG equals the sum of the squares on GF and FE,  therefore the square on EG is double the square on EF.And EF equals CD, therefore the square on EG is double the square on CD. But the square on EA was also proved to be double the square on AC, therefore the sum of the squares on AE and EG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.And the square on AG equals the sum of the squares on AE and EG,  therefore the square on AG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD. But the sum of the squares on AD and DG equals the square on AG, therefore the sum of the squares on AD and DG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.And DG equals DB, therefore the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD.Therefore if a straight line is bisected, and a straight line is added to it in a straight line, then the square on the whole with the added straight line and the square on the added straight line both together are double the sum of the square on the half and the square described on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line as on one straight line.

VLet AB be the given straight line.It is required to cut AB so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments equals the square on the remaining segment.Describe the square ABDC on AB.  Bisect AC at the point E, and join BE.Draw CA through to F, and make EF equal to BE.  Describe the square FH on AF, and draw GH through to K.I say that AB has been cut at H so that the rectangle AB by BH equals the square on AH.Since the straight line AC has been bisected at E, and FA is added to it, the rectangle CF by FA together with the square on AE equals the square on EF.But EF equals EB, therefore the rectangle CF by FA together with the square on AE equals the square on EB.But the sum of the squares on BA and AE equals the square on EB, for the angle at A is right,  therefore the rectangle CF by FA together with the square on AE equals the sum of the squares on BA and AE.Subtract the square on AE  from each. Therefore the remaining rectangle CF by FA equals the square on AB.Now the rectangle CF by FA is FK, for AF equals FG, and the square on AB is AD, therefore FK equals AD.Subtract AK from each. Therefore FH, which remains, equals HD.And HD is the rectangle AB by BH, for AB equals BD, and FH is the square on AH, therefore the rectangle  AB by BH equals the square on HA.Therefore the given straight line AB has been cut at H so that the rectangle  AB by BH  equals the square on HA.

VLet ABC be an obtuse-angled triangle having the angle BAC obtuse, and draw BD from the point B perpendicular to CA produced.I say that the square on BC is greater than the sum of the squares on BA and AC by twice the rectangle CA by AD.Since the straight line CD has been cut at random at the point A, the square on DC equals the sum of the squares on CA and AD and twice the rectangle CA by AD.Add the square on DB be added to each. Therefore the sum of the squares on CD and DB equals the sum of the squares on CA, AD,  and DB plus twice the rectangle CA by AD.But the square on CB equals the sum of the squares on CD and DB, for the angle at D is right,  and the square on AB equals the sum of the squares on AD and DB, therefore the square on CB equals the sum of the squares on CA and AB plus twice the rectangle  CA by AD, so that the square on CB is greater than the sum of the squares on CA and AB by twice the rectangle  CA by AD.Therefore in obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the obtuse angle is greater than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the obtuse angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular towards the obtuse angle.

VLet ABC be a triangle having the angle at B acute, and draw AD from the point A perpendicular to BC.I say that the square on AC is less than the sum of the squares on CB and BA by twice the rectangle CB by BD.Since the straight line CB has been cut at random at D, the sum of the squares on CB and BD equals twice the rectangle CB by BD plus the square on DC.Add the square on DA to each.  Therefore the sum of the squares on CB, BD, and DA equals twice the rectangle CB by BD plus the sum of the  squares on AD and DC.But the square on AB equals the sum of the squares on BD and  DA, for the angle at D is right,  and the square on AC equals the sum of the squares on AD and DC, therefore the sum of the squares on CB and BA equals the square on AC plus twice the rectangle CB by BD, so that the square on AC alone is less than the sum of the squares on CB and BA by twice the rectangle CB by BD.Therefore in acute-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the acute angle is less than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the acute angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular towards the acute angle.

VLet A be the given rectilinear figure.It is required to construct a square equal to the rectilinear figure A.Construct the rectangular parallelogram BD equal to the rectilinear figure A.Then, if BE equals ED, then that which was proposed is done, for a square BD has been constructed equal to the rectilinear figure A.But, if not, one of the straight lines BE or ED is greater.Let BE be greater, and  produce it to F. Make EF equal to ED, and bisect BF at G.Describe the semicircle BHF with center G and radius one of the straight lines GB or GF. Produce DE to H, and join GH.Then, since the straight line BF has been cut into equal segments at G and into unequal segments at E, the rectangle BE by EF together with the square on EG equals the square on GF.But GF equals GH, therefore the rectangle BE by EF together with the square on GE equals the square on GH.But the sum of the squares on HE and EG equals the square on GH, therefore the rectangle BE by EF together with the square on GE equals the sum of the squares on HE and EG.Subtract the square on GE from each. Therefore the remaining rectangle BE by EF equals the square on EH.But the rectangle BE by EF is BD, for EF equals ED, therefore the parallelogram BD equals the square on HE.And BD equals the rectilinear figure A.Therefore the rectilinear figure A also equals the square which can be described on EH.Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on EH, has been constructed equal to the given rectilinear figure A.

Draw DC from D  at right angles to AB, and draw it through to E.  Bisect CE at F.I say that F is the center of the circle ABC.For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let G be the center. Join GA, GD, and GB.Then, since AD equals DB, and DG is common, the two sides AD and DG equal the two sides BD and DG respectively.  And the base GA equals the base GB, for they are radii, therefore the angle ADG equals the angle GDB.But, when a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right,  therefore the angle GDB is right.But the angle FDB is also right, therefore the angle FDB equals the angle GDB, the greater equals the less, which is impossible.  Therefore G is not the center of the circle ABC.Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except F.Therefore the point F is the center of the circle ABC.

VLet ABC be a circle, and let two points A and B be taken at random on its circumference.I say that the straight line joined from A to B falls within the circle.For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as AEB. Take the center D of the circle ABC. Join DA and DB, and draw DFE through.Then, since DA equals DB, the angle DAE also equals the angle DBE.And, since one side AEB of the triangle DAE is produced, the angle DEB is greater than the angle DAE.And the angle DAE equals the angle DBE, therefore the angle DEB is greater than the angle DBE.  And the side opposite the greater angle is greater, therefore DB is greater than DE.  But DB equals DF, therefore DF is greater than DE, the less greater than the greater, which is impossible.Therefore the straight line joined from A to B does not fall outside the circle. Similarly we can prove that neither does it fall on the circumference itself, therefore it falls within.Therefore if two points are taken at random on the circumference of a circle, then the straight line joining the points falls within the circle.

VLet a straight line CD passing through the center of a circle ABC bisect a straight line AB not passing through the center at the point F.I say that it also cuts it at right angles.Take the center E of the circle ABC, and join EA and EB.Then, since AF equals FB, and FE is common, two sides equal two sides, and the base EA equals the base EB, therefore the angle AFE equals the angle BFE.But, when a straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, therefore each of the angles AFE and BFE is right.Therefore CD, which passes through the center and bisects AB which does not pass through the center, also cuts it at right angles.Next, let CD cut AB at right angles.I say that it also bisects it,  that is, that AF equals FB.For, with the same construction, since EA equals EB, the angle EAF also equals the angle EBF.But the right angle AFE equals the right angle BFE, therefore EAF and EBF are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely EF, which is common to them, and opposite one of the equal angles. Therefore they  also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sidesTherefore AF equals FB.Therefore if a straight line passing through the center of a circle bisects a straight line not passing through the center, then it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cuts it at right angles, then it also bisects it.

Take the center F of the circle ABCD.  Join FE.Then, since a straight line FE passing through the center bisects a straight line AC not passing through the center, it also cuts it at right angles, therefore the angle FEA is right.Again, since a straight line FE bisects a straight line BD, it also cuts it at right angles.  Therefore the angle FEB is right.But the angle FEA was also proved right, therefore the angle FEA equals the angle FEB, the less equals the greater, which is impossible. Therefore AC and BD do not bisect one another.Therefore if in a circle two straight lines which do not pass through the center cut one another, then they do not bisect one another.

VLet ABCD be a circle, and let AD be a diameter of it. Let F be a point F on AD which is not the center of the circle. Let E be the center of the circle.  Let straight lines FB, FC, and FG fall upon the circle ABCD from F.I say that FA is greatest, FD is least, and of the rest FB is greater than FC, and FC greater than FG.Join BE, CE, and GE.Then, since in any triangle the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining one, the sum of EB and EF is greater than BF.But AE equals BE, therefore AF is greater than BF.Again, since BE equals CE, and FE is common, the two sides BE and EF equal the two sides CE and EF.   But the angle BEF is also greater than the angle CEF, therefore the base BF is greater than the base CF.For the same reason CF is also greater than GF.Again, since the sum of GF and FE is greater than EG, and EG equals ED, the sum of GF and FE is greater than ED.Subtract EF  from each.  Therefore the remainder GF is greater than the remainder FD.Therefore FA is greatest, FD is least, FB is greater than FC, and FC greater than FG.I say also that from the point F only two equal straight lines fall on the circle ABCD, one on each side of the least FD.Construct the angle FEH equal to the angle GEF on the straight line EF and at the point E on it.  Join FH.Then, since GE equals EH, and EF is common, the two sides GE and EF equal the two sides HE and EF, and the angle GEF equals the angle HEF, therefore the base FG equals the base FH.I say again that another straight line equal to FG does not fall on the circle from the point F.For, if possible, let FK so fall.Then, since FK equals FG, and FH equals FG, FK also equals FH, the nearer to the straight line through the center being thus equal to the more remote, which is impossible.Therefore another straight line equal to GF does not fall from the point F upon the circle.  Therefore only one straight line  so falls.Therefore if on the diameter of a circle a point is taken which is not the center of the circle, and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle, then that is greatest on which passes through the center, the remainder of the same diameter is least, and of the rest the nearer to the straight line through the center is always greater than the more remote; and only two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle, one on each side of the least straight line.

VLet ABC be a circle, and let a point D be taken outside ABC. Let straight lines DA, DE, DF, and DC be drawn through from D, and let DA be drawn through the center. I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference AEFC, the straight line DA through the center is greatest, while DE is greater than DF, and DF greater than DC.   But, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference HLKG, the straight line DG between the point and the diameter AG is least, and the nearer to the least DG is always less than the more remote, namely DK is less than DL, and DL is less than DH.Take the center M of the circle ABC.   Join ME, MF, MC, MK, ML,  and MH.Then, since AM equals EM, add MD to each, therefore AD equals the sum of EM and MD.But the sum of EM and MD is greater than ED, therefore AD is also greater than ED.Again, since ME equals MF, and MD is common, therefore EM and MD equal FM and MD, and the angle EMD is greater than the angle FMD, therefore the base ED is greater than the base FD.Similarly we can prove that FD is greater than CD.  Therefore DA is greatest, while DE is greater than DF, and DF is greater than DC.Next, since the sum of MK and KD is greater than MD, and MG equals MK, therefore the remainder KD is greater than the remainder GD, so that GD is less than KD.And, since on MD, one of the sides of the triangle MLD, two straight lines MK and KD are constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore the sum of MK and KD is less than the sum of ML and LD.  And MK equals ML, therefore the remainder DK is less than the remainder DL.Similarly we can prove that DL is also less than DH.  Therefore DG is least, while DK is less than DL, and DL is less than DH.I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point D on the circle, one on each side of the least DG.Construct the angle DMB equal to the angle KMD on the straight line MD and at the point M on it.  Join DB.Then, since MK equals MB, and MD is common, the two sides KM and MD equal the two sides BM and MD respectively, and the angle KMD equals the angle BMD, therefore the base DK equals the base DB.I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line DK falls on the circle from the point D.For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be DN.  Then, since DK equals DN, and DK equals DB, DB also equals DN, that is, the nearer to the least DG equal to the more remote, which was proved impossible.Therefore no more than two equal straight lines fall on the circle ABC from the point D, one on each side of DG the least.Therefore if a point is taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines are drawn through to the circle, one of which is through the center and the others are drawn at random, then, of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference, that through the center is greatest, while of the rest the nearer to that through the center is always greater than the more remote, but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference, that between the point and the diameter is least, while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote; and only two equal straight lines fall on the circle from the point, one on each side of the least.

VLet D a point within a circle ABC, and from D let more than two equal straight lines, namely DA and DB and DC, fall on the circle ABC.I say that the point D is the center of the circle ABC.Join AB and BC, and bisect them at the points E and F.  Join ED and FD, and draw them through to the points G, K, H, and L.Then, since AE equals EB, and ED is common, the two sides AE and ED equal the two sides BE and ED, and the base DA equals the base DB, therefore the angle AED equals the angle BED.Therefore the angles AED and BED are each right. Therefore GK cuts AB into two equal parts and at right angles.And since, if in a circle a straight line cuts a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the center of the circle is on the cutting straight line, therefore the center of the circle is on GK.For the same reason the center of the circle ABC is also on HL.And the straight lines GK and HL have no other point common but the point D, therefore the point D is the center of the circle ABC.Therefore if a point is taken within a circle, and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle, then the point taken is the center of the circle.

Draw  KC and LM from K and L at right angles to BH and BG,  and carry them through to the points A and E.Then, since in the circle ABC a straight line AC cuts a straight line BH into two equal parts and at right angles, the center of the circle ABC lies on AC.  Again, since in the same circle ABC a straight line NO cuts a straight line BG into two equal parts and at right angles, the center of the circle ABC lies on NO.>But it was also proved to lie on AC, and the straight lines AC and NO meet at no point except at P, therefore the point P is the center of the circle ABC.Similarly we can prove that P is also the center of the circle DEF, therefore the two circles ABC and DEF which cut one another have the same center P, which is impossible.Therefore a circle does not cut a circle at more than two points.

Join  AF and AG.Then, since the sum of AG and GF is greater than FA, that is, than FH, subtract FG from each, therefore the remainder AG is greater than the remainder GH.But AG equals GD, therefore GD is also greater than GH, the less greater than the greater, which is impossible. Therefore the straight line joined from F to G does not fall outside. Therefore it falls on A, the point of contact.Therefore if two circles touch one another internally, and their centers are taken, then the straight line joining their centers, being produced, falls on the point of contact of the circles.

VFor, if possible, let the circle ABDC touch the circle EBFD, first internally, at more points than one, namely D and B.Take the center G of the circle ABDC and the center H of EBFD.Therefore the straight line joined from G to H falls on B and D.Let it so fall, as BGHD.Then, since the point G is the center of the circle ABCD and BG equals GD, therefore BG is greater than HD.  Therefore BH is much greater than HD.Again, since the point H is the center of the circle EBFD, BH equals HD, but it was also proved much greater than it, which is impossible. Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one. I say further that neither does it so touch it externally.For, if possible, let the circle ACK touch the circle ABDC at more points than one, namely A and C.  Join AC.Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles ABDC and ACK two points A and C have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points falls within each circle, but it fell within the circle ABCD and outside ACK, which is absurd.Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one. And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally.Therefore a circle does not touch another circle at more than one point whether it touches it internally or externally.

VLet AB and CD be equal straight lines in a circle ABDC.I say that AB and CD are equally distant from the center.Take the center E of the circle ABDC. Draw EF and EG from E  perpendicular to AB and CD, and join AE and EC.Then, since a straight line EF passing through the center cuts a straight line AB not passing through the center at right angles, it also bisects it.  Therefore AF equals FB. Therefore AB is double AF.For the same reason CD is also double CG. But AB equals CD, therefore AF also equals CG.Also, since AE equals EC, the square on AE also equals the square on EC.  But the sum of the squares on AF and EF equals the square on AE, for the angle at F is right, and the sum of the squares on EG and GC equals the square on EC, for the angle at G is right.  Therefore the sum of the squares on AF and FE equals the sum of the squares on CG and GE, of which the square on AF equals the square on CG, for AF equals CG.  Therefore the remaining square on FE equals the square on EG.  Therefore EF equals EG.But straight lines in a circle are said to be equally distant from the center when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the center are equal.  Therefore AB and CD are equally distant from the center.Next, let the straight lines AB and CD be equally distant from the center, that is, let EF equal EG.I say that AB also equals CD.For, with the same construction, we can prove, as before, that AB is double AF, and CD double CG.  And, since AE equals CE, the square on AE equals the square on CE.  But the sum of the squares on EF and FA equals the square on AE, and the sum of the squares on EG and GC equals the square on CE.Therefore the sum of the squares on EF and FA equals the sum of the squares on EG and GC, of which the square on EF equals the square on EG, for EF equals EG. Therefore the remaining square on AF equals the square on CG.  Therefore AF equals CG.  And AB is double AF, and CD double CG, therefore AB equals CD.Therefore equal straight lines in a circle are equally distant from the center, and those which are equally distant from the center equal one another.

I say that AD is greatest and BC greater than FG.Draw EH and EK from the center E perpendicular to BC and FG.Then, since BC is nearer to the center and FG more remote, EK is greater than EH.Make EL  equal to EH. Draw LM through L at right angles to EK, and carry it through to N. Join ME, EN, FE, and EG.Then, since EH equals EL, BC also equals MN.Again, since AE equals EM, and ED equals EN, AD equals the sum of ME and EN.But the sum of ME and EN is greater than MN, and MN equals BC, therefore AD is greater than BC.And, since the two sides ME and EN equal the two sides FE and EG, and the angle MEN greater than the angle FEG, therefore the base MN is greater than the base FG.But MN was proved equal to BC.Therefore the diameter AD is greatest and BC greater than FG.Therefore of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest, and of the rest the nearer to the center is always greater than the more remote.

VLet ABC be a circle about D as center and AB as diameter. I say that the straight line drawn from A at right angles to AB from its end will fall outside the circle.For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as CA, and join DC.Since DA equals DC, the angle DAC also equals the angle ACD.But the angle DAC is right, therefore the angle ACD is also right.  Thus, in the triangle ACD, the two angles DAC and ACD equal two right angles, which is impossible.Therefore the straight line drawn from the point A at right angles to BA will not fall within the circle. Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference, therefore it will fall outside. Let it fall as AE.I say next that into the space between the straight line AE and the circumference CHA another straight line cannot be interposed.For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as FA. Draw DG from the point D perpendicular to FA.Then, since the angle AGD is right, and the angle DAG is less than a right angle, AD is greater than DG.But DA equals DH, therefore DH is greater than DG, the less greater than the greater, which is impossible. Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference. I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA is greater than any acute rectilinear angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE is less than any acute rectilinear angle. For, if there is any rectilinear angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, and any rectilinear angle less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line AE a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE.But such a straight line cannot be interposed, therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE.Therefore the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its end will fall outside the circle, and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed, further the angle of the semicircle is greater, and the remaining angle less, than any acute rectilinear angle.

VLet A be the given point, and BCD the given circle. It is required to draw from the point A a straight line touching the circle BCD.Take the center E of the circle, and join AE.  Describe the circle AFG with center E and radius EA.  Draw DF from D at right angles to EA.  Join EF and AB.I say that AB has been drawn from the point A touching the circle BCD.For, since E is the center of the circles BCD and AFG, EA equals EF, and ED equals EB.  Therefore the two sides AE and EB equal the two sides FE and ED, and they contain a common angle, the angle at E, therefore the base DF equals the base AB, and the triangle DEF equals the triangle BEA, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles, therefore the angle EDF equals the angle EBA.But the angle EDF is right, therefore the angle EBA is also right.Now EB is a radius, and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its end, touches the circle, therefore AB touches the circle BCD.Therefore from the given point A the straight line AB has been drawn touching the circle BCD.

VFor let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC at the point C.  Take the center F of the circle ABC, and join FC from F to C.I say that FC is perpendicular to DE.For, if not, draw FG from F perpendicular to DE.Then, since the angle FGC is right, the angle FCG is acute, and the side opposite the greater angle is greater, therefore FC is greater than FG.But FC equals FB, therefore FB is also greater than FG, the less greater than the greater, which is impossible.Therefore FG is not perpendicular to DE.Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except FC. Therefore FC is perpendicular to DE.Therefore if a straight line touches a circle, and a straight line is joined from the center to the point of contact, the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent.

VFor let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC at the point C. Draw CA from C at right angles to DE.I say that the center of the circle is on AC.For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let F be the center, and join CF.Since a straight line DE touches the circle ABC, and FC has been joined from the center to the point of contact, FC is perpendicular to DE. Therefore the angle FCE is right.But the angle ACE is also right, therefore the angle FCE equals the angle ACE, the less equals the greater, which is impossible. Therefore F is not the center of the circle ABC.Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on AC.Therefore if a straight line touches a circle, and from the point of contact a straight line is drawn at right angles to the tangent, the center of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn.

Therefore the sum of the angles the angles EAB and EBA is double the angle EAB.But the angle BEF equals the sum of the angles EAB and EBA, therefore the angle BEF, is also double the angle EAB.For the same reason the angle FEC is also double the angle EAC.Therefore the whole angle BEC is double the whole angle BAC.Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there be another angle BDC.  Join DE and produced it to G.Similarly then we can prove that the angle GEC is double the angle EDC, of which the angle GEB is double the angle EDB. Therefore the remaining angle BEC is double the angle BDC.Therefore in a circle the angle at the center is double the angle at the circumference when the angles have the same circumference as base.

I say that the sum of the opposite angles equals two right angles.Join AC and BD.Then, since in any triangle the sum of the three angles equals two right angles, the sum of the three angles CAB, ABC, and BCA of the triangle ABC equals two right angles.But the angle CAB equals the angle BDC, for they are in the same segment BADC, and the angle ACB equals the angle ADB, for they are in the same segment ADCB, therefore the whole angle ADC equals the sum of the angles BAC and ACB.Add the angle ABC to each. Therefore the sum of the angles ABC, BAC, and ACB equals the sum of the angles ABC and ADC.  But the sum of the angles ABC, BAC, and ACB equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles ABC and ADC also equal two right angles.Similarly we can prove that the sum of the angles BAD and DCB also equals two right angles.Therefore the sum of the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles equals two right angles.

VLet ABC be the given segment of a circle.It is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment ABC, that is, of which it is a segment.Bisect AC at D, draw DB from the point D at right angles to AC, and join AB.The angle ABD is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle BAD.First let it be greater.  Construct the angle BAE on the straight line BA, and at the point A on it, equal to the angle ABD.  Draw DB through to E, and join EC.Then, since the angle ABE equals the angle BAE, the straight line EB also equals EA.And, since AD equals DC, and DE is common, the two sides AD and DE equal the two sides CD and DE respectively, and the angle ADE equals the angle CDE, for each is right, therefore the base AE equals the base CE.But AE was proved equal to BE, therefore be also equals CE.  Therefore the three straight lines AE, EB, and EC equal one another.Therefore the circle drawn with center E and radius one of the straight lines AE, EB, or EC also passes through the remaining points and has been completed.Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described.And it is manifest that the segment ABC is less than a semicircle, because the center E happens to be outside it.Similarly, even if the angle ABD equals the angle BAD and AD being equal to each of the two BD and DC, the three straight lines DA, DB, and DC will equal one another, D will be the center of the completed circle, and ABC will clearly be a semicircle.But, if the angle ABD is less than the angle BAD, and if we construct, on the straight line BA and at the point A on it, an angle equal to the angle ABD, the center will fall on DB within the segment ABC, and the segment ABC will clearly be greater than a semicircle.Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described.

But the whole circle ABC also equals the whole circle DEF, therefore the remaining circumference BKC equals the circumference ELF.Therefore in equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences whether they stand at the centers or at the circumferences.

Let the angle BGC be greater. Construct the angle BGK equal to the angle EHF on the straight line BG and at the point G on it.Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences when they are at the centers, therefore the circumference BK equals the circumference EF.But EF equals BC, therefore BK also equals BC, the less equals the greater, which is impossible. Therefore the angle BGC is not unequal to the angle EHF, therefore it equals it.And the angle at A is half of the angle BGC, and the angle at D half of the angle EHF, therefore the angle at A also equals the angle at D.Therefore in equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences equal one another whether they stand at the centers or at the circumferences.

VLet ABCD be a circle, let BC be its diameter, and E its center.  Join BA, AC, AD, and DC.I say that the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is right, the angle ABC in the segment ABC greater than the semicircle is less than a right angle, and the angle ADC in the segment ADC less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle.Join AE, and carry BA through to F.Then, since BE equals EA, the angle ABE also equals the angle BAE.  Again, since CE equals EA, the angle ACE also equals the angle CAE.  Therefore the whole angle BAC equals the sum of the two angles ABC and ACB.But the angle FAC exterior to the triangle ABC also equals the sum of the two angles ABC and ACB.  Therefore the angle BAC also equals the angle FAC.  Therefore each is right.  Therefore the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is right.Next, since in the triangle ABC the sum of the two angles ABC and BAC is less than two right angles, and the angle BAC is a right angle, the angle ABC is less than a right angle.  And it is the angle in the segment ABC greater than the semicircle.Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the sum of the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles equals two right angles, while the angle ABC is less than a right angle, therefore the remaining angle ADC is greater than a right angle.  And it is the angle in the segment ADC less than the semicircle.I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference ABC and the straight line AC, is greater than a right angle, and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference ADC and the straight line AC, is less than a right angle. This is at once manifest.  For, since the angle contained by the straight lines BA and AC is right, the angle contained by the circumference ABC and the straight line AC is greater than a right angle. Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines AC and AF is right, the angle contained by the straight line CA and the circumference ADC is less than a right angle.Therefore in a circle the angle in the semicircle is right, that in a greater segment less than a right angle, and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle, and the angle of the less segment is less than a right angle.

Therefore the angle ADB, being an angle in a semicircle, is right.Therefore the sum of the remaining angles BAD and ABD equals one right angle.But the angle ABF is also right, therefore the angle ABF equals the sum of the angles BAD and ABD.Subtract the angle ABD from each.  Therefore the remaining angle DBF equals the angle BAD in the alternate segment of the circle.Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle, the sum of its opposite angles equals two right angles.But the sum of the angles DBF and DBE also equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles DBF and DBE equals the sum of the angles BAD and BCD, of which the angle BAD was proved equal to the angle DBF, therefore the remaining angle DBE equals the angle DCB in the alternate segment DCB of the circle.Therefore if a straight line touches a circle, and from the point of contact there is drawn across, in the circle, a straight line cutting the circle, then the angles which it makes with the tangent equal the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.

VLet AB be the given straight line, and the angle at C the given rectilinear angle.It is required to describe on the given straight line AB a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.The angle at C is then acute, or right, or obtuse.First let it be acute as in the first figure.  Construct the angle BAD equal to the angle at C on the straight line AB and at the point A.  Therefore the angle BAD is also acute.Draw AE at right angles to DA.  Bisect AB at F. Draw FG from the point F at right angles to AB, and join GB.Then, since AF equals FB, and FG is common, the two sides AF and FG equal the two sides BF and FG, and the angle AFG equals the angle BFG, therefore the base AG equals the base BG.Therefore the circle described with center G and radius GA passes through B also. Draw it as ABE, and join EB.Now, since AD is drawn from A, the end of the diameter AE, at right angles to AE, therefore AD touches the circle ABE.Since then a straight line AD touches the circle ABE, and from the point of contact at A a straight line AB has been drawn across in the circle ABE, the angle DAB equals the angle AEB in the alternate segment of the circle.But the angle DAB equals the angle at C, therefore the angle at C also equals the angle AEB.Therefore on the given straight line AB the segment AEB of a circle has been described admitting the angle AEB equal to the given angle, the angle at C.Next let the angle at C be right, and let it be again required to describe on AB a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at C.Let the angle BAD be constructed equal to the right angle at C, as is the case in the second figure.  Bisect AB at F. Describe  the circle AEB with center F and radius either FA or FB.Therefore the straight line AD touches the circle ABE, because the angle at A is right.And the angle BAD equals the angle in the segment AEB, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle.But the angle BAD also equals the angle at C, therefore the angle AEB also equals the angle at C.Therefore again the segment AEB of a circle has been described on AB admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.Next, let the angle at C be obtuse.Construct the angle BAD equal to C on the straight line AB and at the point A as is the case in the third figure.   Draw AE at right angles to AD.  Bisect AB again at F.  Draw FG at right angles to AB, and join GB.Then, since AF again equals FB, and FG is common, the two sides AF and FG equal the two sides BF and FG, and the angle AFG equals the angle BFG, therefore the base AG equals the base BG.Therefore the circle described with center G and radius GA also passes through B.  Let it so pass, as AEB.Now, since AD is drawn at right angles to the diameter AE from its end, AD touches the circle AEB.And AB has been drawn across from the point of contact at A, therefore the angle BAD equals the angle constructed in the alternate segment AHB of the circle.But the angle BAD equals the angle at C.Therefore the angle in the segment AHB also equals the angle at C.Therefore on the given straight line AB the segment AHB of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.

Construct the angle FBC equal to the angle at D on the straight line FB and at the point B on it.Then, since a straight line EF touches the circle ABC, and BC has been drawn across from the point of contact at B, the angle FBC equals the angle constructed in the alternate segment BAC.But the angle FBC equals the angle at D, therefore the angle in the segment BAC equals the angle at D.Therefore from the given circle ABC the segment BAC has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilinear angle, the angle at D.

VFor in the circle ABCD let the two straight lines AC and BD cut one another at the point E.I say that the rectangle  AE by EC equals the rectangle  DE by EB.If now AC and BD are through the center, so that E is the center of the circle ABCD, it is manifest that, AE, EC, DE, and EB being equal, the rectangle AE by EC also equals the rectangle  DE by EB.Next let AC and DB not be through the center.  Take the center F let the center of ABCD.  Draw FG and FH from F perpendicular  to the straight lines AC and DB.  Join FB, FC, and FE.Then, since a straight line GF through the center cuts a straight line AC not through the center at right angles, it also bisects it, therefore AG equals GC.Since, then, the straight line AC has been cut into equal parts at G and into unequal parts at E, the rectangle AE by EC together with the square on EG equals the square on GC.Add the square on GF.  Therefore the rectangle AE by EC plus the sum of the squares on GE and GF equals the sum of the squares on CG and GF.But the square on FE equals the sum of the squares on EG and GF, and the square on FC equals the sum of the squares on CG and GF. Therefore the rectangle AE by EC plus the square on FE equals the square on FC.And FC equals FB, therefore the rectangle AE by EC plus the square on EF equals the square on FB.For the same reason, also, the rectangle DE by EB plus the square on FE equals the square on FB.But the rectangle AE by EC plus the square on FE was also proved equal to the square on FB, therefore the rectangle AE by EC plus the square on FE equals the rectangle DE by EB plus the square on FE.Subtract the square on FE from each.  Therefore the remaining rectangle AE by EC equals the rectangle DE by EB.Therefore if in a circle two straight lines cut one another, then the rectangle contained by the segments of the one equals the rectangle contained by the segments of the other.

VLet a point D be taken outside the circle ABC, and from D let the two straight lines DCA and DB fall on the circle ABC.  Let DCA cut the circle ABC, and let BD touch it.I say that the rectangle  AD by DC equals the square on DB.Then DCA is either through the center or not through the center.First let it be through the center, and let F be the center of the circle ABC.  Join FB.  Therefore the angle FBD is right.And, since AC has been bisected at F, and CD is added to it, the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on FC equals the square on FD.But FC equals FB, therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on FB equals the square on FD.And the sum of the squares on FB and BD equals the square on FD, therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on FB equals the sum of the squares on FB and BD.Subtract the square on FB from each.  Therefore the remaining rectangle AD by DC equals the square on the tangent DB.Again, let DCA not be through the center of the circle ABC. Take the center E, and draw EF from E perpendicular to AC.  Join EB, EC, and ED.Then the angle EBD is right.And, since a straight line EF through the center cuts a straight line AC not through the center at right angles, it also bisects it, therefore AF equals FC.Now, since the straight line AC has been bisected at the point F, and CD is added to it, the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on FC equals the square on FD.Add the square on FE to each.  Therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the sum of the squares on CF and FE equals the sum of the squares on FD and FE.But the square on EC equals the sum of the squares on CF and FE, for the angle EFC is right, and the square on ED equals the sum of the squares on DF and FE, therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on EC equals the square on ED.And EC equals EB, therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on EB equals the square on ED.But the sum of the squares on EB and BD equals the square on ED, for the angle EBD is right, therefore the rectangle AD by DC plus the square on EB equals the sum of the squares on EB and BD.Subtract the square on EB from each.  Therefore the remaining rectangle AD by DC equals the square on DB.Therefore if a point is taken outside a circle and two straight lines fall from it on the circle, and if one of them cuts the circle and the other touches it, then the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex circumference equals the square on the tangent.

VLet a point D be taken outside the circle ABC, from D let the two straight lines DCA and DB fall on the circle ACB, let DCA cut the circle and DB fall on it, and let the rectangle AD by DC equal the square on DB.I say that DB touches the circle ABC.Draw DE touching ABC.  Take the center F of the circle ABC, and join FE, FB, and FD.Thus the angle FED is right.Now, since DE touches the circle ABC, and DCA cuts it, the rectangle AD by DC equals the square on DE.But the rectangle AD by DC was also equal to the square on DB, therefore the square on DE equals the square on DB. Therefore DE equals DB.And FE equals FB, therefore the two sides DE and EF equal the two sides DB and BF, and FD is the common base of the triangles, therefore the angle DEF equals the angle DBF.But the angle DEF is right, therefore the angle DBF is also right.And FB produced is a diameter, and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its end, touches the circle, therefore DB touches the circle.Similarly this can be proved to be the case even if the center is on AC.Therefore if a point is taken outside a circle and from the point there fall on the circle two straight lines, if one of them cuts the circle, and the other falls on it, and if further the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex circumference equals the square on the straight line which falls on the circle, then the straight line which falls on it touches the circle.

Take the center K of the circle ABC, and draw a radius KB at random.  On the straight line KB and at the point K on it, construct the angle BKA equal to the angle DEG, and the angle BKC equal to the angle DFH.  Through the points A, B, and C draw LAM, MBN, and NCL touching the circle ABC.Now, since LM, MN, and NL touch the circle ABC at the points A, B, and C, and KA, KB, and KC have been joined from the center K to the points A, B, and C, therefore the angles at the points A, B, and C are right.And, since the four angles of the quadrilateral AMBK equal four right angles, inasmuch as AMBK is in fact divisible into two triangles, and the angles KAM and KBM are right, therefore the sum of the remaining angles AKB and AMB equals two right angles.But the sum of the angles DEG and DEF also equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles AKB and AMB equals the sum of the angles DEG and DEF, of which the angle AKB equals the angle DEG, therefore the remaining angle AMB equals the remaining angle DEF.Similarly it can be proved that the angle LNB also equals the angle DFE, therefore the remaining angle MLN equals the angle EDF.Therefore the triangle LMN is equiangular with the triangle DEF, and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABC.Therefore a triangle equiangular with the given triangle has been circumscribed about a given circle.

Draw DE, DF, and DG from D  perpendicular to the straight lines AB, BC, and CA.Now, since the angle ABD equals the angle CBD, and the right angle BED also equals the right angle BFD, EBD and FBD are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely that opposite one of the equal angles, which is BD common to the triangles, therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, therefore DE equals DF.For the same reason DG also equals DF.Therefore the three straight lines DE, DF, and DG equal one another.  Therefore the circle described with center D and radius one of the straight lines DE, DF, or DG also passes through the remaining points and touches the straight lines AB, BC, and CA, because the angles at the points E, F, and G are right.For, if it cuts them, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its end will be found to fall within the circle, which was proved absurd, therefore the circle described with center D and radius one of the straight lines DE, DF, or DG does not cut the straight lines AB, BC, and CA  Therefore it touches them, and is the circle inscribed in the triangle ABC.Let it be inscribed as FGE.Therefore the circle EFG has been inscribed in the given triangle ABC.

VLet ABC be the given triangle.It is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle ABC.Bisect the straight lines AB and AC at the points D and E.  Draw DF and EF  from the points D and E at right angles to AB and AC.  They will then meet within the triangle ABC, or on the straight line BC, or outside BC.First let them meet within at F.  Join FB, FC, and FA.Then, since AD equals DB, and DF is common and at right angles, therefore the base AF equals the base FB.Similarly we can prove that CF also equals AF, so that FB also equals FC, therefore the three straight lines FA and FB and FC equal one another.Therefore the circle described with center F and radius one of the straight lines FA, FB, or FC also passes through the remaining points, and the circle is circumscribed about the triangle ABC.Let it be circumscribed as ABC.Next, let DF and EF meet on the straight line BC at F, as is the case in the second figure.  Join AF.Then, similarly, we can prove that the point F is the center of the circle circumscribed about the triangle ABC.Next, let DF and EF meet outside the triangle ABC at F, as is the case in the third figure.  Join AF, BF, and CF.Then again, since AD equals DB, and DF is common and at right angles, therefore the base AF equals the base BF.Similarly we can prove that CF also equals AF, so that BF also equals FC.  Therefore the circle described with center F and radius one of the straight lines FA, FB, or FC also passes through the remaining points, and is circumscribed about the triangle ABC.Therefore a circle has been circumscribed about the given triangle.

VLet ABCD be the given circle.It is required to inscribe a square in the circle ABCD.Draw two diameters AC and BD of the circle ABCD at right angles to one another, and join AB, BC, CD, and DA.Then, since BE equals ED, for E is the center, and EA is common and at right angles, therefore the base AB equals the base AD.For the same reason each of the straight lines BC and CD also equals each of the straight lines AB and AD.  Therefore the quadrilateral ABCD is equilateral.I say next that it is also right-angled.For, since the straight line BD is a diameter of the circle ABCD, therefore BAD is a semicircle, therefore the angle BAD is right.For the same reason each of the angles ABC, BCD, and CDA is also right.  Therefore the quadrilateral ABCD is right-angled.But it was also proved equilateral, therefore it is a square, and it has been inscribed in the circle ABCD.Therefore the square ABCD has been inscribed in the given circle.

VLet ABCD be the given circle.It is required to circumscribe a square about the circle ABCD.Draw two diameters AC and BD of the circle ABCD at right angles to one another.  Draw FG, GH, HK, and KF through the points A, B, C, and D  touching the circle ABCD.Then, since FG touches the circle ABCD, and EA has been joined from the center E to the point of contact at A, therefore the angles at A are right. For the same reason the angles at the points B, C, and D are also right.Now, since the angle AEB is right, and the angle EBG is also right, therefore GH is parallel to AC.For the same reason AC is also parallel to FK, so that GH is also parallel to FK.Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines GF and HK is parallel to BED.Therefore GK, GC, AK, FB, and BK are parallelograms, therefore GF equals HK, and GH equals FK.And, since AC equals BD, and AC also equals each of the straight lines GH and FK, and BD equals each of the straight lines GF and HK, therefore the quadrilateral FGHK is equilateral.I say next that it is also right-angled.For, since GBEA is a parallelogram, and the angle AEB is right, therefore the angle AGB is also right.Similarly we can prove that the angles at H, K, and F are also right. Therefore FGHK is right-angled.But it was also proved equilateral, therefore it is a square, and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABCD.Therefore a square has been circumscribed about the given circle.

VLet ABCD be the given square.It is required to inscribe a circle in the given square ABCD.Bisect the straight lines AD and AB at the points E and F respectively.  Draw EH  through E parallel to either AB or CD, and draw FK  through F parallel to either AD or BC.Therefore each of the figures AK, KB, AH, HD, AG, GC, BG, and GD is a parallelogram, and their opposite sides are evidently equal.Now, since AD equals AB, and AE is half of AD, and AF half of AB, therefore AE equals AF, so that the opposite sides are also equal, therefore FG equals GE.Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines GH and GK equals each of the straight lines FG and GE. Therefore the four straight lines GE, GF, GH, and GK equal one another.Therefore the circle described with center G and radius one of the straight lines GE, GF, GH, or GK also passes through the remaining points.And it touches the straight lines AB, BC, CD, and DA, because the angles at E, F, H, and K are right.For, if the circle cuts AB, BC, CD, or DA, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its end will fall within the circle, which was proved absurd. Therefore the circle described with center G and radius one of the straight lines GE, GF, GH, or GK does not cut the straight lines AB, BC, CD, and DA.Therefore it touches them, and has been inscribed in the square ABCD.Therefore a circle has been inscribed in the given square.

VSet out any straight line AB, and cut it at the point C so that the rectangle AB by BC equals the square on CA.  Describe the circle BDE with center A and radius AB.  Fit in the circle BDE the straight line BD equal to the straight line AC which is not greater than the diameter of the circle BDE.Join AD and DC, and circumscribe the circle ACD about the triangle ACD.Then, since the rectangle AB by BC equals the square on AC, and AC equals BD, therefore the rectangle AB by BC equals the square on BD.And, since a point B was taken outside the circle ACD, and from B the two straight lines BA and BD fall on the circle ACD, and one of them cuts it while the other falls on it, and the rectangle AB by BC equals the square on BD, therefore BD touches the circle ACD.Since, then, BD touches it, and DC is drawn across from the point of contact at D, therefore the angle BDC equals the angle DAC in the alternate segment of the circle.Since, then, the angle BDC equals the angle DAC, add the angle CDA to each, therefore the whole angle BDA equals the sum of the two angles CDA and DAC.But the exterior angle BCD equals the sum of the angles CDA and DAC, therefore the angle BDA also equals the angle BCD.But the angle BDA equals the angle CBD, since the side AD also equals AB, so that the angle DBA also equals the angle BCD.Therefore the three angles BDA, DBA, and BCD equal one another.And, since the angle DBC equals the angle BCD, the side BD also equals the side DC.But BD equals CA by hypothesis, therefore CA also equals CD, so that the angle CDA also equals the angle DAC.  Therefore the sum of the angles CDA and DAC is double the angle DAC.And the angle BCD equals the sum of the angles CDA and DAC, therefore the angle BCD is also double the angle CAD.But the angle BCD equals each of the angles BDA and DBA, therefore each of the angles BDA and DBA is also double the angle DAB.Therefore the isosceles triangle ABD has been constructed having each of the angles at the base DB double the remaining one.

VLet ABCDE be the given circle.It is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon in the circle ABCDE.Set out the isosceles triangle FGH having each of the angles at G and H double the angle at F.Inscribe in the circle ABCDE the triangle ACD equiangular with the triangle FGH, so that the angles CAD, ACD, and CDA equal the angles at F, G, and H respectively.   Therefore each of the angles ACD and CDA is also double the angle CAD.Now bisect the angles ACD and CDA respectively by the straight lines CE and DB, and join AB, BC, DE, and EA.Then, since each of the angles ACD and CDA is double the angle CAD, and they are bisected by the straight lines CE and DB, therefore the five angles DAC, ACE, ECD, CDB, and BDA equal one another.But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, therefore the five circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA equal one another.But straight lines that cut off equal circumferences are equal, therefore the five straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA equal one another.  Therefore the pentagon ABCDE is equilateral.I say next that it is also equiangular.For, since the circumference AB equals the circumference DE, add BCD to each, therefore the whole circumference ABCD equals the whole circumference EDCB.And the angle AED stands on the circumference ABCD, and the angle BAE on the circumference EDCB, therefore the angle BAE also equals the angle AED.For the same reason each of the angles ABC, BCD, and CDE also equals each of the angles BAE and AED, therefore the pentagon ABCDE is equiangular.But it was also proved equilateral, therefore an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed in the given circle.

VLet ABCDE be the given circle.It is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle ABCDE.Let A, B, C, D, and E be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are equal.  Draw GH, HK, KL, LM, and MG through A, B, C, D, and E touching the circle.   Take the center F of the circle ABCDE, and join FB, FK, FC, FL, and FD.Then, since the straight line KL touches the circle ABCDE at C, and FC has been joined from the center F to the point of contact at C, therefore FC is perpendicular to KL.  Therefore each of the angles at C is right.For the same reason the angles at the points B and D are also right.And, since the angle FCK is right, therefore the square on FK equals the sum of the squares on FC and CK.For the same reason the square on FK also equals the sum of the squares on FB and BK, so that the sum of the squares on FC and CK equals the sum of the squares on FB and BK, of which the square on FC equals the square on FB, therefore the remaining square on CK equals the square on BK.Therefore BK equals CK.And, since FB equals FC, and FK is common, the two sides BF and FK equal the two sides CF and FK, and the base BK equals the base CK, therefore the angle BFK equals the angle KFC, and the angle BKF equals the angle FKC. Therefore the angle BFC is double the angle KFC, and the angle BKC double the angle FKC.For the same reason the angle CFD is also double the angle CFL, and the angle DLC double the angle FLC.Now, since the circumference BC equals CD, the angle BFC also equals the angle CFD.And the angle BFC is double the angle KFC, and the angle DFC double the angle LFC, therefore the angle KFC also equals the angle LFC.But the angle FCK also equals the angle FCL, therefore FKC and FLC are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely FC which is common to them, therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, therefore the straight line KC equals CL, and the angle FKC equals the angle FLC.And, since KC equals CL, therefore KL is double KC.For the same reason it can be proved that HK is also double BK.And BK equals KC, therefore HK also equals KL.Similarly each of the straight lines HG, GM, and ML can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines HK and KL, therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equilateral.I say next that it is also equiangular.For, since the angle FKC equals the angle FLC, and the angle HKL was proved double the angle FKC, and the angle KLM double the angle FLC, therefore the angle HKL also equals the angle KLM.Similarly each of the angles KHG, HGM, and GML can also be proved equal to each of the angles HKL and KLM.  Therefore the five angles GHK, HKL, KLM, LMG, and MGH equal one another.Therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equiangular.And it was also proved equilateral, and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABCDE.

VLet ABCDE be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon.It is required to inscribe a circle in the pentagon ABCDE.Bisect the angles BCD and CDE by the straight lines CF and DF respectively.  Join the straight lines FB, FA, and FE from the point F at which the straight lines CF and DF meet one another.Then, since BC equals CD, and CF common, the two sides BC and CF equal the two sides DC and CF, and the angle BCF equals the angle DCF, therefore the base BF equals the base DF, and the triangle BCF equals the triangle DCF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles, namely those opposite the equal sides.Therefore the angle CBF equals the angle CDF.And, since the angle CDE is double the angle CDF, and the angle CDE equals the angle ABC, while the angle CDF equals the angle CBF, therefore the angle CBA is also double the angle CBF.  Therefore the angle ABF equals the angle FBC.  Therefore the angle ABC is bisected by the straight line BF.Similarly it can be proved that the angles BAE and AED are also bisected by the straight lines FA and FE respectively.Now draw FG, FH, FK, FL, and FM from the point F perpendicular to the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA.Then, since the angle HCF equals the angle KCF, and the right angle FHC also equals the angle FKC, FHC and FKC are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely FC which is common to them and opposite one of the equal angles, therefore they also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides.  Therefore the perpendicular FH equals the perpendicular FK.Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines FL, FM, and FG also equals each of the straight lines FH and FK, therefore the five straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, and FM equal one another.Therefore the circle described with center F and radius one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, or FM also passes through the remaining points, and it touches the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA, because the angles at the points G, H, K, L, and M are right.For, if it does not touch them. but cuts them, it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its end falls within the circle, which was proved absurd.Therefore the circle described with center F and radius one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, or FM does not cut the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA.  Therefore it touches them. Let it be described, as GHKLM.Therefore a circle has been inscribed in the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

VLet ABCDE be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular.It is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon ABCDE.Bisect the angles BCD and CDE by the straight lines CF and DF respectively.  Join the straight lines FB, FA, and FE from the point F at which the straight lines meet to the points B, A, and E.Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles CBA, BAE, and AED are also bisected by the straight lines FB, FA, and FE respectively.Now, since the angle BCD equals the angle CDE, and the angle FCD is half of the angle BCD, and the angle CDF half of the angle CDE, therefore the angle FCD also equals the angle CDF, so that the side FC also equals the side FD.Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines FB, FA, and FE also equals each of the straight lines FC and FD.  Therefore the five straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, and FE equal one another.Therefore the circle described with center F and radius one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, or FE also passes through the remaining points, and is circumscribed.Let it be circumscribed, and let it be ABCDE.Therefore a circle has been circumscribed about the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

VLet ABCDEF be the given circle.It is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in the circle ABCDEF.Draw the diameter AD of the circle ABCDEF.  Take the center G of the circle.  Describe the circle EGCH with center D and radius DG.  Join EG and CG and carry them through to the points B and F.  Join AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA.I say that the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and equiangular.For, since the point G is the center of the circle ABCDEF, GE equals GD.Again, since the point D is the center of the circle GCH, DE equals DG.But GE was proved equal to GD, therefore GE also equals ED.  Therefore the triangle EGD is equilateral, and therefore its three angles EGD, GDE, and DEG equal one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base equal one another.And the sum of the three angles of the triangle equals two right angles, therefore the angle EGD is one-third of two right angles.Similarly, the angle DGC can also be proved to be one third of two right angles.And, since the straight line CG standing on EB makes the sum of the adjacent angles EGC and CGB equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle CGB is also one-third of two right angles.Therefore the angles EGD, DGC, and CGB equal one another, so that the angles vertical to them, the angles BGA, AGF, and FGE, are equal.Therefore the six angles EGD, DGC, CGB, BGA, AGF, and FGE equal one another.But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, therefore the six circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA equal one another.And straight lines that cut off equal circumferences are equal, therefore the six straight lines equal one another.  Therefore the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral.I say next that it is also equiangular.For, since the circumference FA equals the circumference ED, add the circumference ABCD to each, therefore the whole FABCD equals the whole EDCBA.  And the angle FED stands on the circumference FABCD, and the angle AFE on the circumference EDCBA, therefore the angle AFE equals the angle DEF.Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon ABCDEF are also severally equal to each of the angles AFE and FED, therefore the hexagon ABCDEF is equiangular.But it was also proved equilateral, and it has been inscribed in the circle ABCDEF.Therefore an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed in the given circle.

VLet ABCD be the given circle.It is required to inscribe in the circle ABCD a fifteen-angled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular.Inscribe a side AC of an equilateral triangle and a side AB of an equilateral pentagon in in the circle ABCD.   Therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle ABCD, there will be five in the circumference ABC which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference AB which is one-fifth of the circle.  Therefore in the remainder BC there will be two of the equal segments.Inscribe a side AC of an equilateral triangle and a side AB of an equilateral pentagon in in the circle ABCD.   Therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle ABCD, there will be five in the circumference ABC which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference AB which is one-fifth of the circle.  Therefore in the remainder BC there will be two of the equal segments.Bisect BC at E.  Therefore each of the circumferences BE and EC is a fifteenth of the circle ABCD.If therefore we join BE and EC and continually fit into the circle ABCD straight lines equal to them, a fifteen-angled figure which is both equilateral and equiangular will be inscribed in it.

Then the number of the magnitudes AG and GB equals the number of the magnitudes CH and HD.Now, since AG equals E, and CH equals F, therefore the sum of AG and CH equals the sum of E and F.For the same reason GB equals E, and the sum of GB and HD equals the sum of E and F. Therefore, there are as many magnitudes in AB equal to E as there are in the sum of AB and CD equal to the sum of E and F.  Therefore, the sum of AB and CD is the same multiple of the sum of E and F that AB is of E.Therefore, if  any number of magnitudes are each the same multiple of the same number of other magnitudes, then the sum is that multiple of the sum.

Then the number of the magnitudes EK and KF equals the number of the magnitudes GL and LH.And, since A is the same multiple of B that C is of D, while EK equals A, and GL equals C, therefore EK is the same multiple of B that GL is of D.For the same reason KF is the same multiple of B that LH is of D.Since a first magnitude EK is the same multiple of a second B that a third GL is of a fourth D, and a fifth KF is the same multiple of the second B that a sixth LH is of the fourth D, therefore the sum EF of the first and fifth is the same multiple of the second B that the sum GH of the third and sixth is of the fourth D.Therefore, if a first magnitude is the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth, and if equimultiples are taken of the first and third, then the magnitudes taken also are equimultiples respectively, the one of the second and the other of the fourth.

For the same reason M is the same multiple of B that N is of D.And, since A is to B as C is to D, and equimultiples K and L have been taken of A and C, and other, arbitrary, equimultiples M and N of B and D, therefore, if K is in excess of M, then L is in excess of N; if it is equal, equal; and if less, less.And K and L are equimultiples of E and F, and M and N are other, arbitrary, equimultiples of G and H, therefore E is to G as F is to H.Therefore, if a first magnitude has to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, then any equimultiples whatever of the first and third also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in corresponding order.

Therefore GF equals CD.Subtract CF from each.  Then the remainder GC equals the remainder FD.And, since AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is of GC, and GC equals DF, therefore AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is of FD.But, by hypothesis, AE is the same multiple of CF that AB is of CD, therefore EB is the same multiple of FD that AB is of CD.That is, the remainder EB is the same multiple of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.Therefore, If a magnitude is the same multiple of a magnitude that a subtracted part is of a subtracted part, then the remainder also is the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

Then the remainder KC equals the remainder HD.But F equals KC, therefore HD also equals F.Hence, if GB equals E, HD also equals F.Similarly we can prove that, even if GB is a multiple of E, HD is also the same multiple of F.Therefore, if two magnitudes are equimultiples of two magnitudes, and any magnitudes subtracted from them are equimultiples of the same, then the remainders either equal the same or are equimultiples of them.

VLet A and B be equal magnitudes and C an arbitrary magnitude.I say that each of the magnitudes A and B has the same ratio to C, and C has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A and B.Take equimultiples D and E of A and B, and take an arbitrary multiple F of C.Then, since D is the same multiple of A that E is of B, and A equals B, therefore D equals E.But F is another, arbitrary, magnitude.  If therefore D is in excess of F, then E is also in excess of F; if equal, equal; and, if less, less.And D and E are equimultiples of A and B, while F is another, arbitrary, multiple of C, therefore A is to C as B is to C.I say next that C also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A and B.With the same construction, we can prove similarly that D equals E, and F is some other magnitude.  If therefore F is in excess of D, it is also in excess of E; if equal, equal; and, if less, less.And F is a multiple of C, while D and E are other, arbitrary, equimultiples of A and B, therefore C is to A as C is to B.Therefore, equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio; and the same has to equal magnitudes the same ratio.

VLet AB and C be unequal magnitudes, and let AB be greater, and let D be another, arbitrary, magnitude.I say that AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D, and D has to C a greater ratio than it has to AB.Since AB is greater than C, make EB equal to C. Then the less of the magnitudes AE and EB, if multiplied, will eventually be greater than D.First, let AE be less than EB.  Let AE be multiplied, and let FG be a multiple of it which is greater than D.  Make GH the same multiple of EB and K the same multiple of C that FG is of AE.Take L double of D and M triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is the first multiple of D that is greater than K. Let it be taken, and let it be N which is quadruple of D and the first multiple of it greater than K.Since K is less than N first, therefore K is not less than M.And, since FG is the same multiple of AE that GH is of EB, therefore FG is the same multiple of AE that FH is of AB.But FG is the same multiple of AE that K is of C, therefore FH is the same multiple of AB that K is of C. Therefore FH and K are equimultiples of AB and C.Again, since GH is the same multiple of EB that K is of C, and EB equals C, therefore GH equals K.But K is not less than M, therefore neither is GH less than M.And FG is greater than D, therefore the whole FH is greater than the sum of D and M.But the sum of D and M equals N, inasmuch as M is triple D, and the sum of M and D is quadruple D, while N is also quadruple D, therefore the sum of M and D equals N.But FH is greater than the sum of M and D, therefore FH is in excess of N, while K is not in excess of N.And FH and K are equimultiples of AB and C, while N is another, arbitrary, multiple of D, therefore AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D.I say next, that D has to C a greater ratio than D has to AB.With the same construction, we can prove similarly that N is in excess of K, while N is not in excess of FH.And N is a multiple of D, while FH and K are other, arbitrary, equimultiples of AB and C, therefore D has to C a greater ratio than D has to AB.Next, let AE be greater than EB.Then the less, EB, if multiplied, will eventually be greater than D.Let it be multiplied, and let GH be a multiple of EB and greater than D.  Make FG the same multiple of AE, and K the same multiple of C that GH is of EB.Then we can prove similarly that FH and K are equimultiples of AB and C, and, similarly, take N the first multiple of D that is greater than FG, so that FG is again not less than M.But GH is greater than D, therefore the whole FH is in excess of the sum of D and M, that is, of N.Now K is not in excess of N, inasmuch as FG also, which is greater than GH, that is, than K, is not in excess of N.And in the same manner, by following the above argument, we complete the demonstration.Therefore, of unequal magnitudes, the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has; and the same has to the less a greater ratio than it has to the greater.

So that, in addition, if G is in excess of L, then the sum of G, H, and K is in excess of the sum of L, M, and N; if equal, equal; and if less, less.Now G and the sum of G, H, and K are equimultiples of A and the sum of A, C, and E, since, if any number of magnitudes are each the same multiple the same number of other magnitudes, then the sum is that multiple of the sum.For the same reason L and the sum of L, M, and N are also equimultiples of B and the sum of B, D, and F, therefore A is to B as the sum of A, C, and E is to the sum of B, D, and F.Therefore, if any number of magnitudes are proportional, then one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents is to the sum of the consequents.

Let G and H be equimultiples of C and E, and K and L other, arbitrary, equimultiples of D and F, so that G is in excess of K, but H is not in excess of L.  Whatever multiple G is of C, let M also be that multiple of A, and, whatever multiple K is of D, let N also be that multiple of B.Now, since A is to B as C is to D, and of A and C equimultiples M and G have been taken, and of B and D other, arbitrary, equimultiples N and K, therefore, if M is in excess of N, G is also in excess of K; if equal, equal; and if less, less.But G is in excess of K, therefore M is also in excess of N.But H is not in excess of L, and M and H are equimultiples of A and E, and N and L other, arbitrary, equimultiples of B and F, therefore A has to B a greater ratio than E has to F.Therefore, if a first magnitude has to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, and the third has to the fourth a greater ratio than a fifth has to a sixth, then the first also has to the second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth.

Therefore AE is to EB as CG is to GD.But also, by hypothesis, AE is to EB as CF is to FD. Therefore CG is to GD as CF is to FD.But the first CG is greater than the third CF, therefore the second GD is also greater than the fourth FD.But it is also less, which is impossible. Therefore AB is to BE as CD is not to a less magnitude than FD.Similarly we can prove that neither is it in that ratio to a greater, it is therefore in that ratio to FD itself.Therefore, if magnitudes are proportional taken separately, then they are also proportional taken jointly.

VLet the whole AB be to the whole CD as the part AE subtracted is to the part CF subtracted.I say that the remainder EB is also to the remainder FD as the whole AB is to the whole CD.Since AB is to CD as AE is to CF, therefore alternately, BA is to AE as DC is to CF.And, since the magnitudes are proportional taken jointly, they are also proportional taken separately, that is, BE is to EA as DF is to CF, and, alternately, BE is to DF as EA is to FC.But, by hypothesis, AE is to CF as is the whole AB to the whole CD.Therefore the remainder EB is also to the remainder FD as the whole AB is to the whole CD.Therefore if a whole is to a whole as a part subtracted is to a part subtracted, then the remainder is also to the remainder as the whole is to the whole.

And A is to B as E is to F, therefore G is to H as M is to N.Next, since B is to C as D is to E, alternately, also, B is to D as C is to E.And, since H and K are equimultiples of B and D, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples, therefore B is to D as H is to K.But B is to D as C is to E, therefore also,  H is to K as C is to E.Again, since L and M are equimultiples of C and E, therefore C is to E as L is to M.But C is to E as H is to K, therefore also, H is to K as L is to M, and, alternately, H is to L as K is to M.But it was also proved that G is to H as M is to N.Since, then, there are three magnitudes G, H, and L, and others equal to them in multitude K, M, and N, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them is perturbed, therefore, ex aequali, if G is in excess of L, K is also in excess of N; if equal, equal; and if less, less.And G and K are equimultiples of A and D, and L and N of C and F.Therefore A is to C as D is to F.Therefore, if there are three magnitudes, and others equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them be perturbed, then they are also in the same ratio ex aequali.

VLet ACB and ACD be triangles, and let CE and CF be parallelograms under the same height.I say that the base CB is to the base CD as the triangle ACB is to the triangle ACD, and as the parallelogram CE is to the parallelogram CF.Produce BD in both directions to the points H and L.  Make any number of straight lines BG and GH equal to the base CB, and any number of straight lines DK and KL equal to the base CD.  Join AG, AH, AK, and AL.Then, since CB, BG, and GH equal one another, the triangles ACB, ABG, and AGH also equal one another.Therefore, whatever multiple the base CH is of the base CB, the triangle ACH is also that multiple of the triangle ACB.For the same reason, whatever multiple the base CL is of the base CD,  the triangle ACL is also that multiple of the triangle ACD.  And, if the base CH equals the base CL, then the triangle ACH also equals the triangle ACL; if the base CH is in excess of the base CL, the triangle ACH is also in excess of the triangle ACL; and, if less, less.Thus, there being four magnitudes, namely two bases CB and CD, and two triangles ACB and ACD, equimultiples have been taken of the base CB and the triangle ACB, namely the base CH and the triangle ACH, and other, arbitrary, equimultiples of the base CD and the triangle ADC, namely the base CL and the triangle ACL, and it has been proved that, if the base CH is in excess of the base CL, the triangle ACH is also in excess of the triangle ACL; if equal, equal; and, if less, less.  Therefore the base CB is to the base CD as the triangle ACB is to the triangle ACD.Next, since the parallelogram CE is double the triangle ACB,  and the parallelogram FC is double the triangle ACD, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples, therefore  the triangle ACB is to the triangle ACD as the parallelogram CE is to the parallelogram FC.Since, then, it was proved that  the base CB is to CD as the triangle ACB is to the triangle ACD, and  the triangle ACB is to the triangle ACD as the parallelogram CE is to the parallelogram CF, therefore also the base CB is to the base CD as the parallelogram CE is to the parallelogram FC.Therefore, triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases.

VLet DE be drawn parallel to BC, one of the sides of the triangle ABC.I say that BD is to AD as CE is to AE.Join BE and CD.Therefore the triangle BDE equals the triangle CDE, for they are on the same base DE and in the same parallels DE and BC.And ADE is another triangle.But equals have the same ratio to the same, therefore the triangle BDE is to the triangle ADE as the triangle CDE is to the triangle ADE.But the triangle BDE is to ADE as BD is to AD, for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from E to AB, they are to one another as their bases.For the same reason, the triangle CDE is to ADE as CE is to AE.Therefore BD is to AD also as CE is to AE.Next, let the sides AB and AC of the triangle ABC be cut proportionally, so that BD is to AD as CE is to AE.  Join DE.I say that  DE is parallel to BC.With the same construction, since BD is to AD as CE is to AE, but BD is to AD as the triangle BDE is to the triangle ADE, and CE is to AE as the triangle CDE is to the triangle ADE, therefore the triangle BDE is to the triangle ADE as the triangle CDE is to the triangle ADE.Therefore each of the triangles BDE and CDE has the same ratio to ADE.Therefore the triangle BDE equals the triangle CDE, and they are on the same base DE.But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels.Therefore DE is parallel to BC.Therefore, if a straight line is drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle, then it  cuts the sides of the triangle proportionally; and, if the sides of the triangle are cut proportionally, then the line joining the points of section is parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.

VLet ABC be a triangle, and let the angle BAC be bisected by the straight line AD.I say that DB is to DC as AB is to AC.Draw CE through C parallel to DA, and carry AB  through to meet it at E.Then, since the straight line AC falls upon the parallels AD and EC, the angle ACE equals the angle CAD.But the angle CAD equals the angle BAD by hypothesis, therefore the angle BAD also equals the angle ACE.Again, since the straight line BAE falls upon the parallels AD and EC, the exterior angle BAD equals the interior angle AEC.But the angle ACE was also proved equal to the angle BAD, therefore the angle ACE also equals the angle AEC, so that the side AE also equals the side AC.And, since AD is parallel to EC, one of the sides of the triangle BCE, therefore, proportionally DB is to DC as AB is to AE.But AE equals AC, therefore DB is to DC as AB is to AC.Next, let DB be to DC as AB is to AC.  Join AD.I say that the straight line AD bisects the angle BAC.With the same construction, since DB is to DC as AB is to AC, and also DB is to DC as AB is to AE, for AD is parallel to EC, one of the sides of the triangle BCE, therefore also AB is to AC as AB is to AE.Therefore AC equals AE, so that the angle AEC also equals the angle ACE.But the angle AEC equals the exterior angle BAD, and the angle ACE equals the alternate angle CAD, therefore the angle BAD also equals the angle CAD.Therefore the straight line AD bisects the angle BAC.Therefore, if an angle of a triangle is bisected by a straight line cutting the base, then the segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle; and, if segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle, then the straight line joining the vertex to the point of section bisects the angle of the triangle.

VLet ABC and DCE be equiangular triangles having the angle ABC equal to the angle DCE, the angle BAC equal to the angle CDE, and the angle ACB equal to the angle CED.I say that  in the triangles ABC and DEC the sides about the equal angles are proportional where the corresponding sides are opposite the equal angles.Let BC be placed in a straight line with CE.Then, since the sum of the angles ABC and ACB is less than two right angles, and the angle ACB equals the angle DEC, therefore the sum of the angles ABC and DEC is less than two right angles.  Therefore BA and ED, when produced, will meet. Let them be produced and meet at F.Now, since the angle DCE equals the angle ABC, DC is parallel to FB.  Again, since the angle ACB equals the angle DEC, AC is parallel to FE.Therefore FACD is a parallelogram, therefore FA equals DC, and AC equals FD.And, since AC is parallel to a side FE of the triangle FBE, therefore BA is to AF as BC is to CE.But FD equals AC, therefore BC is to CE as AC is to DE, and alternately BC is to CA as CE is to ED.Since then it was proved that AB is to BC as DC is to CE, and BC is to CA as CE is to ED, therefore, ex aequali, BA is to AC as CD is to DE.Therefore, in equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles are proportional where the corresponding sides are opposite the equal angles.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having their sides proportional, so that AB is to BC as DE is to EF, BC is to CA as EF is to FD, and further BA is to AC as ED is to DF.I say that the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF where the equal angles are opposite the corresponding sides, namely the angle ABC equals the angle DEF, the angle BCA equals the angle EFD, and the angle BAC equals the angle EDF.Construct the angle FEG equal to the angle CBA and the angle EFG equal to the angle BCA on the straight line EF and at the points E and F on it. Therefore the remaining angle at A equals the remaining angle at G.Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle GEF.Therefore in the triangles ABC and GEF the sides about the equal angles are proportional where the corresponding sides are opposite the equal angles, therefore AB is to BC as GE is to EF.But, by hypothesis, AB is to BC as DE to EF, therefore DE is to EF as GE is to EF.Therefore each of the straight lines DE and GE has the same ratio to EF, therefore DE equals GE.For the same reason DF also equals GF.Then since DE equals GE, and EF is common, the two sides DE and EF equal the two sides GE and EF, and the base DF equals the base GF, therefore the angle DEF equals the angle GEF, and the triangle DEF equals the triangle GEF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles, namely those opposite the equal sides.Therefore the angle DFE also equals the angle GFE, and the angle EDF equals the angle EGF.And, since the angle DEF equals the angle GEF, and the angle GEF equals the angle ABC, therefore the angle ABC also equals the angle DEF.For the same reason the angle ACB also equals the angle DFE, and further, the angle at A equals the angle at D, therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF.Therefore, if two triangles have their sides proportional, then the triangles are equiangular with the equal angles opposite the corresponding sides.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having one angle BAC equal to one angle EDF and the sides about the equal angles proportional, so that BA is to AC as ED is to DF.I say that the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF, and has the angle ABC equal to the angle DEF, and the angle ACB equal to the angle DFE.On the straight line DF and at the points D and F on it, construct the angle FDG equal to either of the angles BAC or EDF, and the angle DFG equal to the angle ACB.Therefore the remaining angle at B equals the remaining angle at G.  Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DGF. Therefore, proportionally BA is to AC as GD is to DF.But, by hypothesis, BA is to AC also as ED is to DF, therefore also ED is to DF as GD is to DF.Therefore ED equals GD. And DF is common, therefore the two sides ED and DF equal the two sides GD and DF, and the angle EDF equals the angle GDF, therefore the base EF equals the base GF,  the triangle DEF equals the triangle DGF, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles, namely those opposite the equal sides.Therefore the angle DFG equals the angle DFE, and the angle DGF equals the angle DEF.But the angle DFG equals the angle ACB, therefore the angle ACB also equals the angle DFE.And, by hypothesis, the angle BAC also equals the angle EDF, therefore the remaining angle at B also equals the remaining angle at E.  Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF.Therefore, if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional, then the triangles are equiangular and have those angles equal opposite the corresponding sides.

VLet ABC and DEF be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle BAC equal to the angle EDF, the sides about other angles ABC and DEF proportional, so that AB is to BC as DE is to EF.  And, first, each of the remaining angles at C and F less than a right angle.I say that the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF, the angle ABC equals the angle DEF, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at C, equals the remaining angle, the angle at F.If the angle ABC does not equal the angle DEF, then one of them is greater.Let the angle ABC be greater.  Construct the angle ABG equal to the angle DEF on the straight line AB and at the point B on it.Then, since the angle A equals D, and the angle ABG equals the angle DEF, therefore the remaining angle AGB equals the remaining angle DFE.Therefore the triangle ABG is equiangular with the triangle DEF.Therefore AB is to BG as DE is to EF.But, by hypothesis, DE is to EF as AB is to BC, therefore AB has the same ratio to each of the straight lines BC and BG.  Therefore BC equals BG, so that the angle at C also equals the angle BGC.But, by hypothesis, the angle at C is less than a right angle, therefore the angle BGC is also less than a right angle, so that the angle AGB adjacent to it is greater than a right angle.And it was proved equal to the angle at F, therefore the angle at F is also greater than a right angle.  But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle, which is absurd.Therefore the angle ABC is not unequal to the angle DEF. Therefore it equals it.But the angle at A also equals the angle at D, therefore the remaining angle at C equals the remaining angle at F.Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF.Next let each of the angles at C and F be supposed not less than a right angle.I say again that, in this case too, the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF.With the same construction, we can prove similarly that BC equals BG, so that the angle at C also equals the angle BGC.But the angle at C is not less than a right angle, therefore neither is the angle BGC less than a right angle.Therefore, once more, the angle ABC is not unequal to the angle DEF. Therefore it equals it.But the angle at A also equals the angle at D, therefore the remaining angle at C equals the remaining angle at F.Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DEF.Therefore, if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, the sides about other angles proportional, and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle, then the triangles are equiangular and have those angles equal the sides about which are proportional.

VLet ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle BAC right, and let AD be drawn from A perpendicular to BC.I say that each of the triangles DBA and DAC is similar to the whole ABC, and, further, they are similar to one another.Since the angle BAC equals the angle BDA, for each is right, and the angle at B is common to the two triangles ABC and DBA, therefore the remaining angle ACB equals the remaining angle DAB.  Therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DBA.Therefore BC, which is opposite the right angle in the triangle ABC, is to BA, which is opposite the right angle in the triangle DBA, as AB, which is opposite the angle at C in the triangle ABC, is to DB, which is opposite the equal angle BAD in the triangle DBA, and also as AC  is to DA, which is opposite the angle at B common to the two triangles.Therefore the triangle ABC is both equiangular to the triangle DBA and has the sides about the equal angles proportional.Therefore the triangle ABC is similar to the triangle DBA.In the same manner we can prove that the triangle DAC is also similar tothe triangle ABC.  Therefore each of the triangles DBA and DAC is similar to the whole ABC.I say next that the triangles DBA and DAC are also similar to one another.Since the right angle BDA equals the right angle ADC, and moreover the angle DAB was also proved equal to the angle at C, therefore the remaining angle at B also equals the remaining angle DAC.  Therefore the triangle DBA is equiangular with the triangle ADC.Therefore BD, which is opposite the angle DAB in the triangle DBA, is to AD, which is opposite the angle at C in the triangle DAC equal to the angle DAB, as AD, itself which is opposite the angle at B in the triangle DBA, is to CD, which is opposite the angle DAC in the triangle DAC equal to the angle at B, and also as BA is to AC, these sides opposite the right angles.  Therefore the triangle DBA is similar to the triangle DAC.Therefore, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular is drawn from the right angle to the base, then the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another.

Draw BD from the point B at right angles to the straight line AC, and join AD and DC.Since the angle ADC is an angle in a semicircle, it is right.And, since, in the right-angled triangle ADC, BD has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore BD is a mean proportional between the segments of the base, AB and BC.Therefore a mean proportional BD has been found to the two given straight lines AB and BC.

VLet AB and BC be equal and equiangular parallelograms having the angles at B equal, and let DB and BE be placed in a straight line. Therefore FB and BG are also in a straight line.I say that, in AB and BC, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say,  DB is to BE as BG is to BF.Complete the parallelogram FE.Then since the parallelogram AB equals the parallelogram BC, and FE is another parallelogram, therefore AB is to FE as BC is to FE.But AB is to FE as DB is to BE, and BC is to FE as BG is to BF. Therefore DB is to BE as BG is to BF.Therefore in the parallelograms AB and BC the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.Next, let DB be to BE as BG is to BF.I say that the parallelogram AB equals the parallelogram BC.Since DB is to BE as BG is to BF, while DB is to BE as the parallelogram AB is to the parallelogram FE, and, BG is to BF as the parallelogram BC is to the parallelogram FE, therefore also AB is to FE as BC is to FE.Therefore the parallelogram AB equals the parallelogram BC.Therefore, in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal.

VLet ABC and ADE be equal triangles having one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle BAC equal to the angle DAE.I say that in the triangles ABC and ADE the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that CA is to AD as EA is to AB.Place them so that CA is in a straight line with AD. Therefore EA is also in a straight line with AB.Join BD.Since then the triangle ABC equals the triangle ADE, and ABD is another triangle, therefore the triangle ABC is to the triangle ABD as the triangle ADE is to the triangle ABD.But ABC is to ABD as AC is to AD,  and ADE is to ABD as AE is to AB.Therefore also AC is to AD as AE is to AB.Therefore in the triangles ABC and ADE the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.Next, let the sides of the triangles ABC and ADE be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let AE be to AB as CA is to AD.I say that the triangle ABC equals the triangle ADE.If BD is again joined, since AC is to AD as AE is to AB, while AC is to AD as the triangle ABC is to the triangle ABD, and AE is to AB as the triangle ADE is to the triangle ABD, therefore the triangle ABC is to the triangle ABD as the triangle ADE is to the triangle ABD.Therefore each of the triangles ABC and ADE has the same ratio to ABD.Therefore the triangle ABC equals the triangle ADE.Therefore, in equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal.

VLet the four straight lines AB, CD, E, and F be proportional, so that AB is to CD as E is to F.I say that the rectangle AB by F equals the rectangle CD by E.Draw AG and CH from the points A and C at right angles to the straight lines AB and CD, and make AG equal to F, and CH equal to E.Complete the parallelograms BG and DH.Then since AB is to CD as E is to F, while E equals CH, and F equals AG, therefore AB is to CD as CH is to AG.Therefore in the parallelograms BG and DH the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.But those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal,  therefore the parallelogram BG equals the parallelogram DH.And BG is the rectangle AB by F, for AG equals F, and DH is the rectangle CD by E, for E equals CH, therefore the rectangle AB by F equals the rectangle CD by E.Next, let the rectangle AB by F be equal to the rectangle CD by E.I say that the four straight lines are proportional, so that AB is to CD as E is to F.With the same construction, since the rectangle AB by F equals the rectangle CD by E, and the rectangle AB by F is BG, for AG equals F, and the rectangle CD by E is DH, for CH equals E, therefore BG equals DH.And they are equiangular. But in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.Therefore AB is to CD as CH is to AG.But CH equals E, and AG to F, therefore AB is to CD as E is to F.Therefore, if four straight lines are proportional, then the rectangle contained by the extremes equals the rectangle contained by the means; and, if the rectangle contained by the extremes equals the rectangle contained by the means, then the four straight lines are proportional.

But the rectangle B by D is the square on B, for B equals D, therefore the rectangle A by C equals the square on B.Next, let the rectangle A by C equal the square on B.I say that A is to B as B is to C.With the same construction, since the rectangle A by C equals the square on B, while the square on B is the rectangle B by D, for B equals D, therefore the rectangle A by C equals the rectangle B by D.But, if the rectangle contained by the extremes equals that contained by the means, then the four straight lines are proportional.Therefore A is to B as D is to C.But B equals D, therefore A is to B as B is to C.Therefore, if three straight lines are proportional, then the rectangle contained by the extremes equals the square on the mean; and, if the rectangle contained by the extremes equals the square on the mean, then the three straight lines are proportional.

VLet AB be the given straight line and CE the given rectilinear figure.It is required to describe on the straight line AB a rectilinear figure similar and similarly situated to the rectilinear figure CE.Join DF.  Construct the angle GAB equal to the angle at C, and the angle ABG equal to the angle CDF, on the straight line AB at the points A and B on it.Therefore the remaining angle CFD equals the angle AGB. Therefore the triangle FCD is equiangular with the triangle GAB.Therefore, proportionally, FD is to GB as FC is to GA, and as CD is to AB.Again, construct the angle BGH equal to the angle DFE, and the angle GBH equal to the angle FDE, on the straight line BG and at the points B and G on it.Therefore the remaining angle at E equals the remaining angle at H.  Therefore the triangle FDE is equiangular with the triangle GBH.  Therefore, proportionally, FD is to GB as FE is to GH, and as ED is to HB.But it was also proved that FD is to GB as FC is to GA, and as CD is to AB. Therefore  FC is to AG as CD is to AB, and as FE is to GH, and further as ED is to HB.And, since the angle CFD equals the angle AGB, and the angle DFE equals the angle BGH, therefore the whole angle CFE equals the whole angle AGH.For the same reason the angle CDE also equals the angle ABH.And the angle at C also equals the angle at A, and the angle at E equals the angle at H.Therefore AH is equiangular with CE, and they have the sides about their equal angles proportional.  Therefore the rectilinear figure AH is similar to the rectilinear figure CE.Therefore the rectilinear figure AH has been described similar and similarly situated to the given rectilinear figure CE on the given straight line AB.

VLet ABC and DEF be similar triangles having the angle at B equal to the angle at E, and such that AB is to BC as DE is to EF, so that BC corresponds to EF.I say that  the triangle ABC has to the triangle DEF a ratio duplicate of that which BC has to EF.Take a third proportional BG to BC and EF so that BC is to EF as EF is to BG,  and join AG.Since AB is to BC as DE is to EF, therefore, alternately, AB is to DE as BC is to EF.But BC is to EF as EF is to BG, therefore also AB is to DE as EF is to BG.Therefore in the triangles ABG and DEF the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.But those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal.  Therefore the triangle ABG equals the triangle DEF.Now since BC is to EF as EF is to BG, and, if three straight lines are proportional, the first has to the third a ratio duplicate of that which it has to the second, therefore BC has to BG a ratio duplicate of that which BC has to EF.But BC is to BG as the triangle ABC is to the triangle ABG,  therefore the triangle ABC also has to the triangle ABG a ratio duplicate of that which BC has to EF.But the triangle ABG equals the triangle DEF, therefore the triangle ABC also has to the triangle DEF a ratio duplicate of that which BC has to EF.Therefore, similar triangles are to one another in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides.

VLet ABCDE and FGHKL be similar polygons, and let AB correspond to FG.I say that the polygons ABCDE and FGHKL are divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon ABCDE has to the polygon FGHKL a ratio duplicate of that which AB has to FG.Join BE, CE, GL, and HL.Now, since the polygon ABCDE is similar to the polygon FGHKL, therefore the angle BAE equals the angle GFL, and AB is to AE as GF is to FL.Since then ABE and FGL are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional, therefore the triangle ABE is equiangular with the triangle FGL, so that it is also similar,  therefore the angle ABE equals the angle FGL.But the whole angle ABC also equals the whole angle FGH because of the similarity of the polygons, therefore the remaining angle EBC equals the angle LGH.And, since the triangles ABE and FGL are similar, BE is to AB as GL is to GF.  Also, since the polygons are similar, AB is to BC as FG is to GH.  Therefore, ex aequali, BE is to BC as GL is to GH, that is, the sides about the equal angles EBC and LGH are proportional.  Therefore the triangle EBC is equiangular with the triangle LGH, so that the triangle EBC is also similar to the triangle LGH.For the same reason the triangle ECD is also similar to the triangle LHK.Therefore the similar polygons ABCDE and FGHKL have been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude.I say that  they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and ABE, EBC, and ECD are antecedents, while FGL, LGH, and LHK are their consequents, and that the polygon ABCDE has to the polygon FGHKL a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is AB to FG.Join AC and FH.Then since the polygons are similar, the angle ABC equals the angle FGH, and AB is to BC as FG is to GH, the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle FGH,  therefore the angle BAC equals the angle GFH, and the angle BCA to the angle GHF.And, since the angle BAM equals the angle GFN, and the angle ABM also equals the angle FGN, therefore the remaining angle AMB also equals the remaining angle FNG.  Therefore the triangle ABM is equiangular with the triangle FGN.Similarly we can prove that the triangle BMC is also equiangular with the triangle GNH.Therefore, proportionally, AM is to MB as FN is to NG, and BM is to MC as GN is to NH.  So that, in addition, ex aequali, AM is to MC as FN is to NH.But AM is to MC as the triangle ABM is to MBC, and as AME is to EMC, for they are to one another as their bases.Therefore also one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as are all the antecedents to all the consequents,  therefore the triangle AMB is to BMC as ABE is to CBE.But AMB is to BMC as AM is to MC, therefore AM is to MC as the triangle ABE is to the triangle EBC.For the same reason also FN is to NH as the triangle FGL is to the triangle GLH.And AM is to MC as FN is to NH, therefore the triangle ABE is to the triangle BEC as the triangle FGL is to the triangle GLH, and, alternately, the triangle ABE is to the triangle FGL as the triangle BEC is to the triangle GLH.Similarly we can prove, if BD and GK are joined, that the triangle BEC is to the triangle LGH as the triangle ECD is to the triangle LHK.And since the triangle ABE is to the triangle FGL as EBC is to LGH, and further as ECD is to LHK, therefore also one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents to the sum of the consequents.  Therefore the triangle ABE is to the triangle FGL as the polygon ABCDE is to the polygon FGHKL.But the triangle ABE has to the triangle FGL a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side AB has to the corresponding side FG, for similar triangles are in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides.Therefore the polygon ABCDE also has to the polygon FGHKL a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side AB has to the corresponding side FG.Therefore, similar polygons are divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon has to the polygon a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

VLet the four straight lines AB, CD, EF, and GH be proportional, so that AB is to CD as EF is to GH.  Let the similar and similarly situated rectilinear figures KAB and LCD be described on AB and CD, and the similar and similarly situated rectilinear figures MF and NH be described on EF and GH.I say that KAB is to LCD as MF is to NH.Take a third proportional O to AB and CD, and a third proportional P to EF and GH.Then since AB is to CD as EF is to GH, therefore CD is to O as GH is to P.  Therefore, ex aequali, AB is to O as EF is to P.But AB is to O as KAB is to LCD,  and EF is to P as MF is to NH, therefore KAB is to LCD also as MF is to NH.Next, let KAB be to LCD as MF is to NH.I say also that AB is to CD as EF is to GH.For, if EF is not to GH as AB is to CD, let EF be to QR as AB is to CD.  Describe the rectilinear figure SR similar and similarly situated to either of the two MF or NH on QR.Since then AB is to CD as EF is to QR, and there have been described on AB and CD the similar and similarly situated figures KAB and LCD, and on EF and QR the similar and similarly situated figures MF and SR, therefore KAB is to LCD as MF is to SR.But also, by hypothesis, KAB is to LCD as MF is to NH, therefore also MF is to SR as MF is to NH.Therefore MF has the same ratio to each of the figures NH and SR, therefore NH equals SR.But it is also similar and similarly situated to it, therefore GH equals QR.And, since AB is to CD as EF is to QR, while QR equals GH, therefore AB is to CD as EF is to GH.Therefore, if four straight lines are proportional, then the rectilinear figures similar and similarly described upon them are also proportional; and, if the rectilinear figures similar and similarly described upon them are proportional, then the straight lines are themselves also proportional.

VLet AC and CF be equiangular parallelograms having the angle BCD equal to the angle ECG.I say that the parallelogram AC has to the parallelogram CF the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.Let them be placed so that BC is in a straight line with CG.  Then DC is also in a straight line with CE.Complete the parallelogram DG.  Set out a straight line K, and make it so that BC is to CG as K is to L, and DC is to CE as L is to M.Then the ratios of K to L and of L to M are the same as the ratios of the sides, namely of BC to CG and of DC to CE.But the ratio of K to M is compounded of the ratio of K to L and of that of L to M, so that K has also to M the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. Now since BC is to CG as the parallelogram AC is to the parallelogram CH, and BC is to CG as K is to L, therefore K is to L as AC is to CH.Again, since DC is to CE as the parallelogram CH is to CF,  and DC is to CE as L is to M, therefore L is to M as the parallelogram CH is to the parallelogram CF.Since then it was proved that K is to L as the parallelogram AC is to the parallelogram CH, and L is to M as the parallelogram CH is to the parallelogram CF, therefore, ex aequali K is to M as AC is to the parallelogram CF.But K has to M the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides, therefore AC also has to CF the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.Therefore, equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.

VLet ABCD be a parallelogram, and AC its diameter, and let EG and HK be parallelograms about AC.I say that each of the parallelograms EG and HK is similar both to the whole ABCD and to the other. For, since EF is parallel to a side BC of the triangle ABC, proportionally, BE is to EA as CF is to FA.Again, since FG is parallel to a side CD of the triangle ACD, proportionally, CF is to FA as DG is to GA.Therefore in the parallelograms ABCD and EG, the sides about the common angle BAD are proportional.And, since GF is parallel to DC, the angle AFG equals the angle ACD, and the angle DAC is common to the two triangles ADC and AGF, therefore the triangle ADC is equiangular with the triangle AGF.For the same reason the triangle ACB is also equiangular with the triangle AFE, and the whole parallelogram ABCD is equiangular with the parallelogram EG.Therefore, proportionally, AD is to DC as AG is to GF, DC is to CA as GF is to FA, AC is to CB as AF is to FE, and  CB is to BA as FE is to EA.And, since it was proved that DC is to CA as GF is to FA, and AC is to CB as AF is to FE, therefore, ex aequali, DC is to CB as GF is to FE.Therefore in the parallelograms ABCD and EG the sides about the equal angles are proportional.  Therefore the parallelogram ABCD is similar to the parallelogram EG.For the same reason the parallelogram ABCD is also similar to the parallelogram KH.  Therefore each of the parallelograms EG and HK is similar to ABCD.But figures similar to the same rectilinear figure are also similar to one another, therefore the parallelogram EG is also similar to the parallelogram HK.Therefore, in any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another.

VLet ABC be the given rectilinear figure to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, and D that to which it must be equal.It is required to construct one figure similar to ABC and equal to D.Let there be applied to BC the parallelogram BE equal to the triangle ABC, and to CE the parallelogram CM equal to D in the angle FCE which equals the angle CBL.Then BC is in a straight line with CF, and LE with EM.Take a mean proportional GH to BC and CF, and describe KGH similar and similarly situated to ABC on GH.Then, since BC is to GH as GH is to CF, and, if three straight lines are proportional, then the first is to the third as the figure on the first is to the similar and similarly situated figure described on the second, therefore BC is to CF as the triangle ABC is to the triangle KGH.But BC is to CF as the parallelogram BE is to the parallelogram EF.Therefore also the triangle ABC is to the triangle KGH as the parallelogram BE is to the parallelogram EF.  Therefore, alternately, the triangle ABC is to the parallelogram BE as the triangle KGH is to the parallelogram EF.But the triangle ABC equals the parallelogram BE, therefore the triangle KGH also equals the parallelogram EF.  And the parallelogram EF equals D, therefore KGH also equals D.And KGH is also similar to ABC. Therefore this figure KGH has been constructed similar to the given rectilinear figure ABC and equal to the other given figure D.

VFrom the parallelogram ABCD let there be taken away the parallelogram AF similar and similarly situated to ABCD, and having the angle DAB common with it.I say that  ABCD is about the same diameter with AF.For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let AHC be the diameter.  Produce GF and carry it through to H.  Draw HK through H parallel to either of the straight lines AD or BC.Since, then, ABCD is about the same diameter with KG, therefore DA is to AB as GA is to AK.But also, since ABCD and EG are similar, therefore DA is to AB as GA is to AE.  Therefore  GA is to AK as GA is to AE.Therefore GA has the same ratio to each of the straight lines AK and AE.Therefore AE equals AK the less equals the greater, which is impossible.Therefore ABCD cannot fail to be about the same diameter with AF.  Therefore the parallelogram ABCD is about the same diameter with the parallelogram AF.Therefore, if from a parallelogram there is taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it, then it is about the same diameter with the whole.

Let there be applied to the straight line AB the parallelogram AD falling short by the parallelogrammic figure DB described on the half of AB, that is, CB.I say that, of all the parallelograms applied to AB falling short by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to DB, AD is greatest.Let there be applied to the straight line AB the parallelogram AF falling short by the parallelogrammic figure FB similar and similarly situated to DB.I say that AD is greater than AF.Since the parallelogram DB is similar to the parallelogram FB, therefore they are about the same diameter.Draw their diameter DB, and describe the figure.Then, since CF equals FE,  and FB is common, therefore the whole CH equals the whole KE.But CH equals CG, since AC also equals CB.Therefore CG also equals KE.Add CF to each.  Therefore the whole AF equals the gnomon LMN, so that the parallelogram DB, that is, AD, is greater than the parallelogram AF.Therefore, of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line falling short by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to that described on the half of the straight line, that parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the straight line and is similar to the difference.

Describe EBFG similar and similarly situated to D on EB, and complete the parallelogram AG.If then AG equals C, that which was proposed is done, for the parallelogram AG equal to the given rectilinear figure C has been applied to the given straight line AB but falling short by a parallelogram GB similar to D.But, if not, let HE be greater than C.Now HE equals GB, therefore GB is also greater than C.Construct KLMN equal to GB minus C and similar and similarly situated to D.But D is similar to GB, therefore KM is also similar to GB.Let, then, KL correspond to GE, and LM to GF.Now, since GB equals C and KM, therefore GB is greater than KM, therefore also GE is greater than KL, and GF than LM.Make GO equal to KL, and GP equal to LM, and let the parallelogram OGPQ be completed, therefore it is equal and similar to KM.Therefore GQ is also similar to GB,  therefore GQ is about the same diameter with GB.Let GQB be their diameter, and describe the figure.Then, since BG equals C and KM, and in them GQ equals KM, therefore the remainder, the gnomon UWV, equals the remainder C.And, since PR equals OS, add QB to each, therefore the whole PB equals the whole OB.But OB equals TE, since the side AE also equals the side EB,  therefore TE also equals PB.Add OS to each.  Therefore the whole TS equals the whole, the gnomon VWU.But the gnomon VWU was proved equal to C, therefore TS also equals C.Therefore there the parallelogram ST equal to the given rectilinear figure C has been applied to the given straight line AB but falling short by a parallelogram QB similar to D.

Describe the parallelogram BF on EB similar and similarly situated to D, and construct GH equal to the sum of BF and C and similar and similarly situated to D.Let KH correspond to FL and KG to FE.Now, since GH is greater than FB, therefore KH is also greater than FL, and KG greater thanFE.Produce FL and FE.  Make FLM equal to KH, and FEN equal to KG. Complete MN.  Then MN is both equal and similar to GH.But GH is similar to EL, therefore MN is also similar to EL,  therefore EL is about the same diameter with MN.Draw their diameter FO, and describe the figure.Since GH equals the sum of EL and C, while GH equals MN, therefore MN also equals the sum of EL and C.Subtract EL from each.  Therefore the remainder, the gnomon XWV, equals C.Now, since AE equals EB, therefore AN equals NB, that is, LP.Add EO to each.  Therefore the whole AO equals the gnomon VWX.But the gnomon VWX equals C, therefore AO also equals C.Therefore the parallelogram AO equal to the given rectilinear figure C has been applied to the given straight line AB but exceeding it by a parallelogram QP similar to D, since PQ is also similar to EL.

VLet ABC and DCE be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC proportional to the two sides DC and DE, so that AB is to AC as DC is to DE, and AB parallel to DC, and AC parallel to DE.I say that BC is in a straight line with CE.Since AB is parallel to DC, and the straight line AC falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles BAC and ACD equal one another.For the same reason the angle CDE also equals the angle ACD, so that the angle BAC equals the angle CDE.And, since ABC and DCE are two triangles having one angle, the angle at A, equal to one angle, the angle at D, and the sides about the equal angles proportional, so that AB is to AC as DC is to DE, therefore the triangle ABC is equiangular with the triangle DCE.  Therefore the angle ABC equals the angle DCE.But the angle ACD was also proved equal to the angle BAC, therefore the whole angle ACE equals the sum of the two angles ABC and BAC.Add the angle ACB to each.  Therefore the sum of the angles ACE and ACB equals the sum of the angles BAC, ACB, and CBA.But the sum of the angles BAC, ABC, and ACB equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles ACE and ACB also equals two right angles.Therefore with a straight line AC, and at the point C on it, the two straight lines BC and CE not lying on the same side make the sum of the adjacent angles ACE and ACB equal to two right angles.  Therefore BC is in a straight line with CE.Therefore, if two triangles having two sides proportional to two sides are placed together at one angle so that their corresponding sides are also parallel, then the remaining sides of the triangles are in a straight line.

VLet ABC and DEF be equal circles, and let the angles BGC and EHF be angles at their centers G and H, and the angles BAC and EDF angles at the circumferences.I say that the circumference BC is to the circumference EF as the angle BGC is to the angle EHF, and as the angle BAC is to the angle EDF.Make any number of consecutive circumferences CK and KL equal to the circumference BC, and any number of consecutive circumferences FM, MN equal to the circumference EF, and join GK and GL and HM and HN.Then, since the circumferences BC, CK, and KL equal one another, the angles BGC, CGK, and KGL also equal one another.  Therefore, whatever multiple the circumference BL is of BC, the angle BGL is also that multiple of the angle BGC.For the same reason, whatever multiple the circumference NE is of EF, the angle NHE is also that multiple of the angle EHF.If the circumference BL equals the circumference EN, then the angle BGL also equals the angle EHN;  if the circumference BL is greater than the circumference EN, then the angle BGL is also greater than the angle EHN; and, if less, less.There being then four magnitudes, two circumferences BC and EF, and two angles BGC and EHF, there have been taken, of the circumference BC and the angle BGC equimultiples, namely the circumference BL and the angle BGL, and of the circumference EF and the angle EHF equimultiples, namely the circumference EN and the angle EHN.And it has been proved that, if the circumference BL is in excess of the circumference EN, the angle BGL is also in excess of the angle EHN; if equal, equal; and if less, less.Therefore the circumference BC is to EF as the angle BGC is to the angle EHF.But the angle BGC is to the angle EHF as the angle BAC is to the angle EDF, for they are doubles respectively.Therefore also the circumference BC is to the circumference EF as the angle BGC is to the angle EHF, and the angle BAC to the angle EDF.Therefore, angles in equal circles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand whether they stand at the centers or at the circumferences.

VThe less of two unequal numbers AB and CD being continually subtracted from the greater, let the number which is left never measure the one before it until a unit is left.I say that AB and CD are relatively prime, that is, that a unit alone measures AB and CD.If AB and CD are not relatively prime, then some number E measures them. Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself, let AF, measuring DG, leave GC less than itself, and let GC, measuring FH, leave a unit HA.Since, then, E measures CD, and CD measures BF, therefore E also measures BF.But it also measures the whole BA, therefore it measures the remainder AF. But AF measures DG, therefore E also measures DG. But it also measures the whole DC, therefore it also measures the remainder CG.But CG measures FH, therefore E also measures FH. But it also measures the whole FA, therefore it measures the remainder, the unit AH, though it is a number, which is impossible.Therefore no number measures the numbers AB and CD. Therefore AB and CD are relatively prime.Therefore, when two unequal numbers are set out, and the less is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left never measures the one before it until a unit is left, then the original numbers are relatively prime.

VLet AB and CD be the two given numbers not relatively prime.It is required to find the greatest common measure of AB and CD.If now CD measures AB, since it also measures itself, then CD is a common measure of CD and AB. And it is clear that it is also the greatest, for no greater number than CD measures CD.But, if CD does not measure AB, then, when the less of the numbers AB and CD being continually subtracted from the greater, some number is left which measures the one before it.For a unit is not left, otherwise AB and CD would be relatively prime, which is contrary to the hypothesis.Therefore some number is left which measures the one before it.Now let CD, measuring BE, leave EA less than itself, let EA, measuring DF, leave FC less than itself, and let CF measure AE.Since then, CF measures AE, and AE measures DF, therefore CF also measures DF. But it measures itself, therefore it also measures the whole CD.But CD measures BE, therefore CF also measures BE. And it also measures EA, therefore it measures the whole BA.But it also measures CD, therefore CF measures AB and CD. Therefore CF is a common measure of AB and CD.I say next that it is also the greatest.If CF is not the greatest common measure of AB and CD, then some number G, which is greater than CF, measures the numbers AB and CD.Now, since G measures CD, and CD measures BE, therefore G also measures BE. But it also measures the whole BA, therefore it measures the remainder AE.But AE measures DF, therefore G also measures DF. And it measures the whole DC, therefore it also measures the remainder CF, that is, the greater measures the less, which is impossible.Therefore no number which is greater than CF measures the numbers AB and CD. Therefore CF is the greatest common measure of AB and CD.

Then the multitude of BG and GC equals the multitude of EH and HF.And, since BG equals A, and EH equals D, therefore the sum of BG and EH also equals the sum of A and D. For the same reason the sum of GC and HF also equals the sum of A and D.Therefore there are as many numbers in BC and EF equal to A and D as there are in BC equal to A.  Therefore, the sum of BC and EF is the same multiple of the sum of A and D that BC is of A. Therefore, the sum of A and D is the same part of the sum of BC and EF that A is of BC.Therefore, if a number is part of a number, and another is the same part of another, then the sum is also the same part of the sum that the one is of the one.

VLet the number AB be that part of the number CD which AE subtracted is of CF subtracted.I say that the remainder EB is also the same part of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.Let EB be the same part of CG that  AE is of CF.Now since EB is the same part of CG that AE is of CF, therefore AB is the same part of GF that AE is of CF.But, by hypothesis, AB is the same part of CD that  AE is of CF, therefore AB is the same part of CD that it is of GF.  Therefore GF equals CD.Subtract CF from each. Then the remainder GC equals the remainder FD.Now since EB is the same part of GC that AE is of CF, and GC equals FD, therefore EB is the same part of FD that AE is of CF.But AB is the same part of CD that AE is of CF, therefore the remainder EB is the same part of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.Therefore, if a number is that part of a number which a  subtracted number is of a subtracted number, then the remainder is also the same part of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

VLet the number AB be the same parts of the number CD that AE subtracted is of CF subtracted.I say that the remainder EB is also the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.Make GH equal to AB.Therefore AE is the same parts of CF that  GH is of CD.Divide GH into the parts of CD, namely GK and KH, and divide AE into the parts of CF, namely AL and LE. Then the multitude of GK and KH equals the multitude of AL and LE.Now since AL is the same part of CF that GK is of CD, and CD is greater than CF, therefore GK is also greater than AL.Make GM equal to AL.Then GK is the same part of CD that  GM is of CF. Therefore the remainder MK is the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD.Again, since EL is the same part of CF that KH is of CD, and CD is greater than CF, therefore HK is also greater than EL.Make KN equal to EL.Therefore KN is the same part of CF that KH is of CD. Therefore the remainder NH is the same part of the remainder FD that the whole KH is of the whole CD.But the remainder MK was proved to be the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD, therefore the sum of MK and NH is the same parts of DF that the whole HG is of the whole CD.But the sum of MK and NH equals EB, and HG equals BA, therefore the remainder EB is the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.Therefore, if a number is the same parts of a number that a subtracted number is of a  subtracted number, then the remainder is also the same parts of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

VLet the number A be a part of the number BC, and and another number D be the same part of another number EF that A is of BC.I say that, alternately, BC is the same part or parts of EF that A is of D.Since D is the same part of EF that A is of BC, therefore there are as many numbers BC equal to A as there are also in EF equal to D.Divide BC into the numbers equal to A, namely BG and GC, and divide EF into those equal to D, namely EH and HF. Then the multitude of BG and GC equals the multitude of EH and HF.Now, since the numbers BG and GC equal one another, and the numbers EH and HF also equal one another, while the multitude of BG and GC equals the multitude of EH and HF, therefore GC is the same part or parts of HF that BG is of EH, so that, in addition, the sum BC is the same part or parts of the sum EF that BG is of EH.But BG equals A, and EH equals D, therefore BC is the same part or parts of EF that A is of D.Therefore, if a number is a part of a number, and another is the same part of another, then alternately, whatever part of parts the first is of the third, the same part, or the same parts, the second is of the fourth.

Then the multitude of AG and GB equals the multitude of DH and HE.Now since DH is the same part of F as AG is of C, therefore, alternately, C is the same part or the same parts of F as  AG is of DH.For the same reason, C is the same part or the same parts of F as GB is of HE, so that, in addition, C is the same part or the same parts of F as AB is of DE.Therefore, if a number is parts of a number, and another is the same parts of another, then alternately, whatever part of parts the first is of the third, the same part, or the same parts, the second is of the fourth.

VLet the unit A measure any number BC, and let another number D measure any other number EF the same number of times.I say that, alternately also, the unit measures the number D the same number of times that BC measures EF.Since the unit A measures the number BC the same number of times that D measures EF, therefore there are as many numbers equal to D in EF as there are units in BC.Divide BC into the units in it, BG, GH, and HC, and divide EF into the numbers EK, KL, and LF equal to D. Then the multitude of BG, GH, and HC equals the multitude of EK, KL, and LF.And, since the units BG, GH, and HC equal one another, and the numbers EK, KL, and LF also equal one another, while the multitude of the units BG, GH, and HC equals the multitude of the numbers EK, KL, and LF, therefore the unit BG is to the number EK as the unit GH is to the number KL, and as the unit HC is to the number LF.Since one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents is to the sum of the consequents, therefore the unit BG is to the number EK as BC is to EF.But the unit BG equals the unit A, and the number EK equals the number D. Therefore the unit A is to the number D as BC is to EF.Therefore the unit A measures the number D the same number of times that BC measures EF.Therefore, if a unit number measures any number, and another number measures any other number the same number of times, then alternately, the unit measures the third number the same number of times that the second measures the fourth.

Since, then, A multiplied by C makes G, and multiplied by D makes E, therefore the number A multiplied by the two numbers C and D makes G and E. Therefore C is to D as G is to E.  But C is to D as A is to B, therefore A is to B as G is to E.Again, since A multiplied by C makes G, but, further, B multiplied by C makes F, therefore the two numbers A and B multiplied by a certain number C make G and F. Therefore A is to B as G is to F.But further A is to B as G is to E, therefore G is to E as G is to F. Therefore G has to each of the numbers E and F the same ratio. Therefore E equals F.Again, let E equal F.I say that A is to B as C is to D.With the same construction, since E equals F, therefore G is to E as G is to F.But G is to E as C is to D,  and G is to F as A is to B,  therefore A is to B as C is to D.Therefore, if four numbers are proportional, then the number produced from the first and fourth equals the number produced from the second and third; and, if the number produced from the first and fourth equals that produced from the second and third, then the four numbers are proportional.

VLet CD and EF be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A and B.I say that CD measures A the same number of times that EF measures B.Now CD is not parts of A. If possible, let it be so. Therefore EF is also the same parts of B that CD is of A.Therefore there are as many parts of B in EF are there are parts of A  in CD.Divide CD into the parts of A, namely CG and GD, and divide EF into the parts of B, namely EH and HF. Thus the multitude of CG and GD equals the multitude of EH and HF.Now, since the numbers CG and GD equal one another, and the numbers EH and HF also equal one another, while the multitude of CG and GD equals the multitude of EH and HF, therefore CG is to EH as GD is to HF.Since one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents is to the sum of the consequents, therefore CG is to EH as CD is to EF.Therefore CG and EH are in the same ratio with CD and EF, being less than they, which is impossible, for by hypothesis CD and EF are the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them. Therefore CD is not parts of A, therefore it is a part of it.And EF is the same part of B that CD is of A, therefore CD measures A the same number of times that EF measures B.Therefore, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times; the greater the greater; and the less the less.

Let them be C and D.Since, then, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater, and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, therefore C measures A the same number of times that D measures B.Let there be as many units in E as the times that C measures A. Then D also measures B according to the units in E.And, since C measures A according to the units in E, therefore E also measures A according to the units in C. For the same reason E also measures B according to the units in D.Therefore E measures A and B which are relatively prime, which is impossible.Therefore there are no numbers less than A and B which are in the same ratio with A and B. Therefore A and B are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.Therefore, numbers relatively prime are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.

VLet the two numbers A and B [each] be relatively prime to a number C, and let A multiplied by B make D.I say that C and D are relatively prime.If C and D are not relatively prime, then some number E measures C and D.Now, since C and A are relatively prime, and a certain number E measures C, therefore A and E are relatively prime.Let there be as many units in F as the times that E measures D.  Then F also measures D according to the units in E.Therefore E multiplied by F makes D.  Also, A multiplied by B makes D, therefore the product of E and F equals the product of A and B.But, if the product of the extremes equal that of the means, then the four numbers are proportional.  Therefore E is to A as B is to F.But A and E are relatively prime, numbers which are relatively prime are also the least of those which have the same ratio, and the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater, and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent,  therefore E measures B.But it also measures C, therefore E measures B and C which are relatively prime, which is impossible.Therefore no number measures the numbers C and D.

But it also measures BA, therefore D measures AB and BC which are relatively prime, which is impossible.Therefore no number measures the numbers CA and AB. Therefore CA and AB are relatively prime. For the same reason AC and CB are also relatively prime. Therefore CA is relatively prime to each of the numbers AB and BC.Next, let CA and AB be relatively prime.I say that AB and BC are also relatively prime.If AB and BC are not relatively prime, then some number D measures AB and BC.Now, since D measures each of the numbers AB and BC, therefore it also measures the whole CA. But it measures AB, therefore D measures CA and AB which are relatively prime, which is impossible.Therefore no number measures the numbers AB and BC. Therefore AB and BC are relatively prime.Therefore, if two numbers are relatively prime, then their sum is also prime to each of them; and, if the sum of two numbers is relatively prime to either of them, then the original numbers are also relatively prime.

But if it is composite, some number measures it. Thus, if the investigation is continued in this way, then some prime number will be found which measures the number before it, which also measures A.

VLet A, B, and C be the given numbers, as many as we please.It is required to find the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, and C.Either A, B, and C are relatively prime or they are not.Now, if A, B, and C are relatively prime, then they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.But, if not, take D the greatest common measure of A, B, and C.  Let there be as many units in the numbers E, F, and G as the times that D measures the numbers A, B, and C respectively.Therefore the numbers E, F, and G measure the numbers A, B, and C respectively according to the units in D. Therefore E, F, and G measure A, B, and C the same number of times. Therefore E, F, and G are in the same ratio with A, B, and C.I say next that they are the least that are in that ratio.If E, F, and G are not the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, and C, then there are numbers less than E, F, and G in the same ratio with A, B, and C. Let them be H, K, and L. Therefore H measures A the same number of times that the numbers K and L measure the numbers B and C respectively.Let there be as many units in M as the times that H measures A. Then the numbers K and L also measure the numbers B and C respectively according to the units in M.And, since H measures A according to the units in M, therefore M also measures A according to the units in H.  For the same reason M also measures the numbers B and C according to the units in the numbers K and L respectively. Therefore M measures A, B, and C.Now, since H measures A according to the units in M, therefore H multiplied by M makes A.  For the same reason also E multiplied by D makes A.Therefore the product of E and D equals the product of H and M. Therefore E is to H as M is to D.But E is greater than H, therefore M is also greater than D. And it measures A, B, and C, which is impossible, for by hypothesis, D is the greatest common measure of A, B, and C.Therefore there cannot be any numbers less than E, F, and G which are in the same ratio with A, B, and C. Therefore E, F, and G are the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, and C.

VLet the two numbers A and B measure any number CD, and let E be the least that they measure.I say that E also measures CD.If E does not measure CD, let E, measuring DF, leave CF less than itself.Now, since A and B measure E, and E measures DF, therefore A and B also measure DF. But they also measure the whole CD, therefore they measure the remainder CF which is less than E, which is impossible.Therefore E cannot fail to measure CD. Therefore it measures it.Therefore, if two numbers measure any number, then the least number measured by them also measures the same.

But C also measures E, therefore A, B, and C also measure E.I say next that it is also the least that they measure.If not, A, B, and C measure some number F less than E.Since A, B, and C measure F, therefore A and B measure F. Therefore the least number measured by A and B also measures F. But D is the least number measured by A and B, therefore D measures F.

VLet the number A be measured by any number B.I say that A has a part called by the same name as B.Let there be as many units in C as the times that B measures A.Since B measures A according to the units in C, and the unit D also measures the number C according to the units in it, therefore the unit D measures the number C the same number of times as B measures A.Therefore, alternately, the unit D measures the number B the same number of times as C measures A. Therefore, whatever part the unit D is of the number B, the same part is C of A also. But the unit D is a part of the number B called by the same name as it, therefore C is also a part of A called by the same name as B, so that A has a part C which is called by the same name as B.Therefore, if a number is measured by any number, then the number which is measured has a part called by the same name as the measuring number.

Multiply A by itself to make C, and by B to make D. Multiply B by itself to make E. Also multiply A by C, D, and E to make F, G, and H, and multiply B by E to make K.Now, since A multiplied by itself makes C, and multiplied by B makes D, therefore A is to B as C is to D.Again, since A multiplied by B makes D, and B multiplied by itself makes E, therefore the numbers A and B multiplied by B make the numbers D and E respectively.Therefore A is to B as D is to E. But A is to B as C is to D, therefore C is to D as D is to E.And, since A multiplied by C and D makes F and G, therefore C is to D as F is to G.But C is to D as A is to B, therefore A is to B as F is to G.Again, since A multiplied by D and E makes G and H, therefore D is to E as G is to H.  But D is to E as A is to B. Therefore A is to B as G is to H.And, since A and B multiplied by E make H and K, therefore A is to B as H is to K.  But A is to B as F is to G, and as G is to H. Therefore F is to G as G is to H, and as H is to K.Therefore C, D, and E, and F, G, H, and K are proportional in the ratio of A to B.I say next that they are the least numbers that are so.Since A and B are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, and the least of those which have the same ratio are relatively prime, therefore A and B are relatively prime.And the numbers A and B multiplied by themselves respectively make the numbers C and E, and multiplied by the numbers C and E respectively make the numbers F and K, therefore C and E and F and K are relatively prime respectively.But, if there are as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are relatively prime, then they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.

VLet as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, and D, in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them.I say that the extremes of them, A and D, are relatively prime.Take two numbers E and F, the least that are in the ratio of A, B, C and D, then three others G, H and K with the same property, and others, more by one continually, until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of the numbers A, B, C, and D. Let them be L, M, N, and O.Since E and F are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, therefore they are relatively prime. And, since the numbers E and F multiplied by themselves respectively make the numbers G and K, and multiplied by the numbers G and K respectively make the numbers L and O, therefore both G and K and L and O are relatively prime.And, since A, B, C, and D are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, while L, M, N, and O are the least that are in the same ratio with A, B, C, and D, and the multitude of the numbers A, B, C, and D equals the multitude of the numbers L, M, N, and O, therefore the numbers A, B, C, and D equal the numbers L, M, N, and O respectively.

VLet the given ratios in least numbers be that of A to B, that of C to D, and that of E to F.It is required to find numbers in continued proportion which are the least that are in the ratio of A to B, in the ratio of C to D, and in the ratio of E to F.Take G, the least number measured by B and C.Let A measure H as many times as B measures G, and let D measure K as many times as C measures G.Now E either measures or does not measure K.First, let it measure it.  Let K measure L as many times as E measures K.Now, since A measures H the same number of times that B measures G, therefore A is to B as H is to G.For the same reason C is to D as G is to K, and E is to F as K is to L. Therefore H, G, K, and L are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B, in the ratio of C to D, and in the ratio of E to F.I say next that they are also the least that have this property.If H, G, K, and L are not the least numbers continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B, of C to D, and of E to F, let them be N, O, M, and P.Then since A is to B as N is to O, while A and B are least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, therefore B measures O.For the same reason C also measures O. Therefore B and C measure O. Therefore the least number measured by B and C also measures O.But G is the least number measured by B and C, therefore G measures O, the greater the less, which is impossible. Therefore there are no numbers less than H, G, K, and L which are continuously in the ratio of A to B, of C to D, and of E to F.Next, let E not measure K.Take M, the least number measured by E and K.  Let H and G measure N and O as many times as K measures M, respectively, and let F measure P as many times as E measures M.Since H measures N the same number of times that G measures O, therefore H is to G as N is to O.  But H is to G as A is to B, therefore A is to B as is N is to O. For the same reason C is to D as is O is to M.Again, since E measures M the same number of times that F measures P, therefore E is to F as M is to P. Therefore N, O, M, and P are continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B, of C to D, and of E to F.I say next that they are also the least that are in the ratios A, B, C, D, E, and F.If not, there are numbers less than N, O, M, and P continuously proportional in the ratios A, B, C, D, E, and F. Let them be Q, R, S, and T.Now since Q is to R as A is to B, while A and B are least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, therefore B measures R.  For the same reason C also measures R, therefore B and C measure R.Therefore the least number measured by B and C also measures R. But G is the least number measured by B and C, therefore G measures R.And G is to R as K is to S,  therefore K also measures S.But E also measures S. Therefore E and K measure S.Therefore the least number measured by E and K also measures S.  But M is the least number measured by E and K, therefore M measures S, the greater the less, which is impossible.Therefore there are no numbers less than N, O, M, and P continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B, of C to D, and of E to F. Therefore N, O, M, and P are the least numbers continuously proportional in the ratios A, B, C, D, E, and F.

VLet the numbers C and D fall between the two numbers A and B in continued proportion with them, and make E in the same ratio to F as A is to B.I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between A and B in continued proportion, so many also fall between E and F in continued proportion.As many as A, B, C, and D are in multitude, take so many numbers G, H, K, and L, the least of those which have the same ratio with A, C, D, and B. Then the extremes of them G and L are relatively prime.Now, since A, C, D, and B are in the same ratio with G, H, K, and L, and the multitude of the numbers A, C, D, and B equals the multitude of the numbers G, H, K, and L, therefore, ex aequali A is to B as G is to L.But A is to B as E is to F, therefore G is to L as E is to F.But G and L are relatively prime, numbers which are relatively prime are also least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent.Therefore G measures E the same number of times as L measures F.Next, let H and K measure M and N, respectively, as many times as G measures E. Then G, H, K, and L measure E, M, N, and F the same number of times. Therefore G, H, K, and L are in the same ratio with E, M, N, and F.But G, H, K, and L are in the same ratio with A, C, D, and B, therefore A, C, D, and B are also in the same ratio with E, M, N, and F.But A, C, D, and B are in continued proportion, therefore E, M, N, and F are also in continued proportion. Therefore, as many numbers as have fallen between A and B in continued proportion with them, so many numbers have also fallen between E and F in continued proportion.Therefore, if between two numbers there fall numbers in continued proportion with them, then, however many numbers fall between them in continued proportion, so many also fall in continued proportion between the numbers which have the same ratios with the original numbers.

VLet A and B be two numbers relatively prime, and let C and D fall between them in continued proportion, and let the unit E be set out.I say that, as many numbers fall between A and B in continued proportion as fall between either of the numbers A or B and the unit in continued proportion.Take two numbers F and G, the least that are in the ratio of A, C, D, and B, three numbers H, K, and L with the same property, and others more by one continually, until their multitude equals the multitude of A, C, D, and B.  Let them be M, N, O, and P.It is now manifest that F multiplied by itself makes H and multiplied by H makes M, while G multiplied by itself makes L and multiplied by L makes P.And, since M, N, O, and P are the least of those which have the same ratio with F and G, and A, C, D, and B are also the least of those which have the same ratio with F and G, while the multitude of the numbers M, N, O, and P equals the multitude of the numbers A, C, D, and B, therefore M, N, O, and P equal A, C, D, and B respectively. Therefore M equals A, and P equals B.Now, since F multiplied by itself makes H, therefore F measures H according to the units in F. But the unit E also measures F according to the units in it, therefore the unit E measures the number F the same number of times as F measures H.Therefore the unit E is to the number F as F is to H.Again, since F multiplied by H makes M, therefore H measures M according to the units in F. But the unit E also measures the number F according to the units in it, therefore the unit E measures the number F the same number of times as H measures M.Therefore the unit E is to the number F as H is to M.But it was also proved that the unit E is to the number F as F is to H, therefore the unit E is to the number F as F is to H, and as H is to M. But M equals A, therefore the unit E is to the number F as F is to H, and as H is to A. For the same reason also the unit E is to the number G as G is to L and as L is to B.Therefore as many numbers fall between A and B in continued proportion as fall between each of the numbers A and B and the unit E in continued proportion.Therefore, If two numbers are relatively prime, and numbers fall between them in continued proportion, then, however many numbers fall between them in continued proportion, so many also fall between each of them and a unit in continued proportion.

VLet the numbers D and E and the numbers F and G respectively fall between the two numbers A and B and the unit C in continued proportion.I say that, as many numbers have fallen between each of the numbers A and B and the unit C in continued proportion as fall between A and B in continued proportion.Multiply D by F to make H, and multiply the numbers D and F by H to make K and L respectively.Now, since the unit C is to the number D as D is to E, therefore the unit C measures the number D the same number of times as D measures E. But the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D, therefore the number D also measures E according to the units in D. Therefore D multiplied by itself makes E.Again, since C is to the number D as E is to A, therefore the unit C measures the number D the same number of times as E measures A. But the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D, therefore E also measures A according to the units in D. Therefore D multiplied by E makes A.For the same reason also F multiplied by itself makes G, and multiplied by G makes B.And, since D multiplied by itself makes E and multiplied by F makes H, therefore D is to F as E is to H.For the same reason also D is to F as H is to G. Therefore E is to H as H is to G.Again, since D multiplied by the numbers E and H makes A and K respectively, therefore E is to H as A is to K. But E is to H as D is to F, therefore D is to F as A is to K.Again, since the numbers D and F multiplied by H make K and L respectively, therefore D is to F as K is to L. But D is to F as A is to K, therefore A is to K as K is to L. Further, since F multiplied by the numbers H and G makes L and B respectively, therefore H is to G as L is to B.But H is to G as D is to F, therefore D is to F as L is to B. But it was also proved that D is to F as A is to K and as K is to L, therefore A is to K as K is to L and as L is to B. Therefore A, K, L, and B are in continued proportion.Therefore, as many numbers as fall between each of the numbers A and B and the unit C in continued proportion, so many also fall between A and B in continued proportion.Therefore, if numbers fall between two numbers and a unit in continued proportion, then however many numbers fall between each of them and a unit in continued proportion, so many also fall between the numbers themselves in continued proportion.

VLet A and B be square numbers, and let C be the side of A, and D of B.I say that between A and B there is one mean proportional number, and A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to D.Multiply C by D to make E.Now, since A is a square and C is its side, therefore C multiplied by itself makes A. For the same reason also, D multiplied by itself makes B.Since, then, C multiplied by the numbers C and D makes A and E respectively, therefore C is to D as A is to E.For the same reason also C is to D as E is to B. Therefore A is to E as E is to B. Therefore between A and B there is one mean proportional number.I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to D.Since A, E, and B are three numbers in proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which A has to E.But A is to E as C is to D, therefore A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which the side C has to D.Therefore, between two square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the square has to the square the duplicate ratio of that which the side has to the side.

VLet A and B be cubic numbers, and let C be the side of A, and D of B.I say that between A and B there are two mean proportional numbers, and A has to K the ratio triplicate of that which C has to D.Multiply C by itself to make E, and by D to make F, multiply D by itself to make G, and multiply the numbers C and D by F to make H and K respectively.Now, since A is a cube, and C its side, and C multiplied by itself makes E, therefore C multiplied by itself makes E and multiplied by E makes A. For the same reason also D multiplied by itself makes G and multiplied by G makes B.And, since C multiplied by the numbers C and D makes E and F respectively, therefore C is to D as E is to F. For the same reason also C is to D as F is to G. Again, since C multiplied by the numbers E and F makes A and H respectively, therefore E is to F as A is to H. But E is to F as C is to D. Therefore C is to D as A is to H.Again, since the numbers C and D multiplied by F make H and K respectively, therefore C is to D as H is to K.  Again, since D multiplied by each of the numbers F and G makes K and B respectively, therefore F is to G as K is to B.But F is to G as C is to D, therefore C is to D as A is to H, as H is to K, and as K is to B.Therefore H and K are two mean proportionals between A and B.I say next that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to D.Since A, H, K, and B are four numbers in proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to H.But A is to H as C is to D, therefore A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to D.Therefore, Between two cubic numbers there are two mean proportional numbers, and the cube has to the cube the triplicate ratio of that which the side has to the side.

VLet there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, and C, in continued proportion, so that A is to B as B is to C. Let A, B, and C multiplied by themselves make D, E, and F, and multiplied by D, E, and F let them make G, H, and K.I say that D, E, and F and G, H, and K are in continued proportion.Multiply A by B to make L, and multiply the numbers A and B by L to make M and N respectively. Also multiply B by C to make O, and multiply the numbers B and C by O to make P and Q respectively.Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we can prove that D, L, and E and G, M, N, and H are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B, and further E, O, and F and H, P, Q, and K are continuously proportional in the ratio of B to C.Now A is to B as B is to C, therefore D, L, and E are also in the same ratio with E, O, and F, and further G, M, N, and H in the same ratio with H, P, Q, and K. And the multitude of D, L, and E equals the multitude of E, O, and F and that of G, M, N, and H to that of H, P, Q, and K, therefore, ex aequali D is to E as E is to F, and G is to H as H is to K.Therefore, if there are as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and each multiplied by itself makes some number, then the products are proportional; and, if the original numbers multiplied by the products make certain numbers, then the latter are also proportional.

For the same reason also E multiplied by F makes B.Multiply D by E to make G. Then, since D multiplied by C makes A, and multiplied by E makes G, therefore C is to E as A is to G.But C is to E as D is to F, therefore D is to F as A is to G. Again, since E multiplied by D makes G, and multiplied by F makes B, therefore D is to F as G is to B.But it was also proved that D is to F as A is to G, therefore A is to G as G is to B. Therefore A, G, and B are in continued proportion.Therefore between A and B there is one mean proportional number.I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which C has to E or D has to F.Since A, G, and B are in continued proportion, A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which it has to G.   And A is to G as C is to E, and as D is to F. Therefore A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to E or D has to F.Therefore, between two similar plane numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the plane number has to the plane number the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

VLet A and B be two similar solid numbers, and let C, D, and E be the sides of A, and let F, G, and H be the sides of B.Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, therefore C is to D as F is to G, and D is to E as G is to H.I say that between A and B there fall two mean proportional numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to F, D has to G, and E has to H.Multiply C by D to make K, and multiply F by G to make L.Now, since C and D are in the same ratio with F and G, and K is the product of C and D, and L the product of F and G, K and L are similar plane numbers, therefore between K and L there is one mean proportional number M.Therefore M is the product of D and F was proved in the theorem preceding.Now, since D multiplied by C makes K, and multiplied by F makes M, therefore C is to F as K is to M.  But K is to M as M is to L. Therefore K, M, and L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F.And since C is to D as F is to G, alternately therefore C is to F as D is to G. For the same reason also D is to G as E is to H.Therefore K, M, and L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F, in the ratio of D to G, and also in the ratio of E to H.Next, multiply E and H by M to make N and O respectively.Now, since A is a solid number, and C, D, and E are its sides, therefore E multiplied by the product of C and D makes A. But the product of C and D is K, therefore E multiplied by K makes A. For the same reason also H multiplied by L makes B.Now, since E multiplied by K makes A, and further also multiplied by M makes N, therefore K is to M as A is to N.But K is to M as C is to F, as D is to G, and as E is to H, therefore C is to F as D is to G, as  E is to H, and as A is to N.Again, since E and H multiplied by M make N and O respectively, therefore E is to H as N is to O.But E is to H as C is to F and as D is to G, therefore C is to F as D is to G, as E is to H, as A is to N, and as N is to O.Again, since H multiplied by M makes O, and further also multiplied by L makes B, therefore M is to L as O is to B. But M is to L as C is to F, a D is to G, and as E is to H. Therefore C is to F as D is to G, and as E is to H, as are O to B, A to N, and N to O.Therefore A, N, O, and B are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides.I say that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, or D has to G, and also E has to H.Since A, N, O, and B are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to N.  But it was proved that A is to N as C is to F, as D  is to G, and as E is to H.Therefore A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, D has to G, and also E has to H.Therefore, between two similar solid numbers there fall two mean proportional numbers, and the solid number has to the solid number the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

VLet one mean proportional number C fall between the two numbers A and B.I say that A and B are similar plane numbers.Take D and E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A and C.  Then D measures A the same number of times that E measures C.Let there be as many units in F as times that D measures A. Then F multiplied by D makes A, so that A is plane, and D and F are its sides.Again, since D and E are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with C and B, therefore D measures C the same number of times that E measures B.Let there be as many units in G as times that E measures B. Then E measures B according to the units in G. Therefore G multiplied by E makes B.Therefore B is plane, and E and G are its sides. Therefore A and B are plane numbers.I say next that they are also similar.Since F multiplied by D makes A, and multiplied by E makes C, therefore D is to E as A is to C, that is, C to B.Again, since E multiplied by F and G makes C and B respectively, therefore F is to G as C is to B. But C is to B as D is to E, therefore D is to E as F is to G. And alternately D is to F as E is to G.Therefore A and B are similar plane numbers, for their sides are proportional.Therefore, if one mean proportional number falls between two numbers, then the numbers are similar plane numbers.

VLet two mean proportional numbers C and D fall between the two numbers A and B.I say that A and B are similar solid numbers.Take three numbers E, F, and G, the least of those which have the same ratio with A, C, and D.  Then the extremes of them E and G are relatively prime.Now, since one mean proportional number F has fallen between E and G, therefore E and G are similar plane numbers.Let, then, H and K be the sides of E, and L and M the sides of G.Therefore it is manifest from the theorem before this that E, F, and G are continuously proportional in the ratio of H to L, and that of K to M.Now, since E, F, and G are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with A, C, and D, and the multitude of the numbers E, F, and G equals the multitude of the numbers A, C, and D, therefore, ex aequali E is to G as A is to D.But E and G are relatively prime, primes are also least, and the least measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent,  therefore E measures A the same number of times that G measures D.Let there be as many units in N as times that E measures A. Then N multiplied by E makes A. But E is the product of H and K, therefore N multiplied by the product of H and K makes A.Therefore A is solid, and H, K, and N are its sides.Again, since E, F, and G are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio as C, D, and B, therefore E measures C the same number of times that G measures B.Let there be as many units in O as times that E measures C.  Then G measures B according to the units in O, therefore O multiplied by G makes B.But G is the product of L and M, therefore O multiplied by the product of L and M makes B. Therefore B is solid, and L, M, and O are its sides. Therefore A and B are solid.I say that they are also similar.Since N and O multiplied by E make A and C, therefore N is to O as A is to C, that is, E to F.But E is to F as H is to L, and as K is to M, therefore H is to L as K is to M, and as N is to O.And H, K, and N are the sides of A, and O, L, and M the sides of B. Therefore A and B are similar solid numbers.Therefore, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, then the numbers are similar solid numbers.

VLet the cubic number A multiplied by any number B make the cubic number C.I say that B is cubic.Multiply A by itself to make D. Then D is a cube.Now, since A multiplied by itself makes D, and multiplied by B makes C, therefore A is to B as D is to C.And since D and C are cubes, therefore they are similar solid numbers. Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between D and C.   And D is to C as A is to B, therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between A and B, too.And A is a cube, therefore B is also a cube.Therefore, if a cubic number multiplied by any number makes a cubic number, then the multiplied number is also cubic.

VLet the number A multiplied by itself make the cubic number B.I say that A is also cubic.Multiply A by B to make C. Since, then, A multiplied by itself makes B, and multiplied by B makes C, therefore C is a cube. And, since A multiplied by itself makes B, therefore A measures B according to the units in itself.But the unit also measures A according to the units in it. Therefore the unit is to A as A is to B.  And, since A multiplied by B makes C, therefore B measures C according to the units in A.But the unit also measures A according to the units in it.Therefore the unit is to A as B is to C.  But the unit is to A as A is to B, therefore A is to B as B is to C.And, since B and C are cubes, therefore they are similar solid numbers.Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between B and C. And B is to C as A is to B. Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between A and B also.And B is a cube, therefore A is also a cube.Therefore, if a number multiplied by itself makes a cubic number, then it itself is also cubic.

VLet there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, E, and F, beginning from a unit and in continued proportion.I say that B, the third from the unit, is square as are all those which leave out one; C, the fourth, is cubic  as are all those which leave out two; and F, the seventh, is at once cubic and square as are all those which leave out five.Since the unit is to A as A is to B, therefore the unit measures the number A the same number of times that A measures B. But the unit measures the number A according to the units in it, therefore A also measures B according to the units in A.Therefore A multiplied by itself makes B, therefore B is square. And, since B, C, and D are in continued proportion, and B is square, therefore D is also square.  For the same reason F is also square.Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one are square.I say next that C, the fourth from the unit, is cubic are also all those which leave out two.Since the unit is to A as B is to C, therefore the unit measures the number A the same number of times that B measures C. But the unit measures the number A according to the units in A, therefore B also measures C according to the units in A. Therefore A multiplied by B makes C. Since then A multiplied by itself makes B, and multiplied by B makes C, therefore C is cubic.And, since C, D, E, and F are in continued proportion, and C is cubic, therefore F is also cubic.  But it was also proved square, therefore the seventh from the unit is both cubic and square. Similarly we can prove that all the numbers which leave out five are also both cubic and square.Therefore,  if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, then the third from the unit is square as are also those which successively leave out one, the fourth is cubic as are also all those which leave out two, and the seventh is at once cubic and square are also those which leave out five.

VLet there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, E, and F, beginning from a unit and in continued proportion, and let A, the number after the unit, not be square.I say that neither are any other square except the third from the unit and those which leave out one.If possible, let C be square. But B is also square, therefore B and C have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number.And B is to C as A is to B, therefore A and B have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, so that A and B are similar plane numbers.And B is square, therefore A is also square, which is contrary to the hypothesis.Therefore C is not square. Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers square except the third from the unit and those which leave out one.Next, let A not be a cube.I say that neither are any other cubes except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two.If possible, let D be a cube.Now C is also a cube, for it is fourth from the unit.  And C is to D as B is to C, therefore B has to C the ratio which a cube has to a cube. And C is a cube, therefore B is also a cube.And since the unit is to A as A is to B, and the unit measures A according to the units in it, therefore A also measures B according to the units in itself. Therefore A multiplied by itself makes the cubic number B.But, if a number multiplied by itself makes cubic number, then it is itself a cube.  Therefore A is also a cube, contrary to the hypothesis. Therefore D is not a cube. Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers a cube except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is not square, then neither is any other square except the third from the unit and all those which leave out one; and, if the number after the unit is not cubic, then neither is any other cubic except the fourth from the unit and all those which leave out two.

Therefore, alternately, the unit A measures D the same number of times as B measures E.But the unit A measures D according to the units in it, therefore B also measures E according to the units in D, so that B the less measures E the greater according to some number of those which have place among the proportional numbers.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, then the less measures the greater according to some one of the numbers which appear among the proportional numbers.

VLet A, B, C, and D be as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit in continued proportion.Let D be measured by any prime number E.I say that E measures A.Suppose it does not.Now E is prime, and any prime number is relatively prime to any which it does not measure, therefore E and A are relatively prime. And, since E measures D, let it measure it according to F, therefore E multiplied by F makes D.Again, since A measures D according to the units in C, therefore A multiplied by C makes D. But, further, E multiplied by F makes D, therefore the product of A and C equals the product of E and F.Therefore A is to E as F is to C. But A and E are relatively prime, primes are also least,  and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent,  therefore E measures C. Let it measure it according to G.Therefore E multiplied by G makes C. But, further, by the previous theorem, A multiplied by B makes C.  Therefore the product of A and B equals the product of E and G.Therefore A is to E as G is to B. But A and E are relatively prime, primes are also least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, therefore E measures B. Let it measure it according to H. Then E multiplied by H makes B.But, further, A multiplied by itself makes B, therefore the product of E and H equals the square on A. Therefore E is to A as A is to H.But A and E are relatively prime, primes are also least, and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, therefore E measures A antecedent antecedent. But, again, it also does not measure it, which is impossible.Therefore E and A are not relatively prime. Therefore they are relatively composite. But numbers relatively composite are measured by some number.And, since E is by hypothesis prime, and a prime is not measured by any number other than itself, therefore E measures A and E, so that E measures A.But it also measures D, therefore E measures A and D. Similarly we can prove that, by whatever prime numbers D is measured, A also is measured by the same.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, then by whatever prime numbers the last is measured, the next to the unit is also measured by the same.Assume that a prime number p divides a power ak of a number a.  Suppose that p does not divide a. Then p is relatively prime to a (VII.29).  From the proportionwe see that the ratio (ak/p) : ak-1 reduces to a : p in lowest terms (VII.21).  Therefore, p divides ak-1 (VII.20).Apply this reduction step repeatedly until the conclusion p divides a is reached.

VLet there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, and D, beginning from a unit and in continued proportion, and let A, the number after the unit, be prime.I say that D, the greatest of them, is not measured by any other number except A, B, or C.If possible, let it be measured by E, and let E not be the same with any of the numbers A, B, or C.It is then clear that E is not prime, for if E is prime and measures D, then it also measures A, which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore E is not prime, so it is composite.But any composite number is measured by some prime number, therefore E is measured by some prime number.I say next that it is no measured by any other prime except A.And, since E measures D, let it measure it according to F.I say that F is not the same with any of the numbers A, B, or C.If F is the same with one of the numbers A, B, or C, and measures D according to E, then one of the numbers A, B, or C also measures D according to E. But one of the numbers A, B, or C measures D according to some one of the numbers A, B, or C, therefore E is also the same with one of the numbers A, B or C, which is contrary to the hypothesis.Therefore F is not the same as any one of the numbers A, B, or C.Similarly we can prove that F is measured by A, by proving again that F is not prime.If it is, and measures D, then it also measures A, which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore F is not prime, so it is composite.But any composite number is measured by some prime number, therefore F is measured by some prime number.I say next that it is not measured by any other prime except A.If any other prime number measures F, and F measures D, then that other also measures D, so that it also measures A, which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore [only the prime] A measures F.And, since E measures D according to F, therefore E multiplied by F makes D.But, further, A multiplied by C makes D, therefore the product of A and C equals the product of E and F.Therefore, proportionally A is to E as F is to C.But A measures E, therefore F also measures C. Let it measure it according to G.Similarly, then, we can prove that G is not the same with any of the numbers A or B, and that it is measured by A. And, since F measures C according to G, therefore F multiplied by G makes C.But, further, A multiplied by B makes C, therefore the product of A and B equals the product of F and G. Therefore, proportionally A is to F as G is to B.But A measures F, therefore G also measures B. Let it measure it according to H.Similarly then we can prove that H is not the same with A.And, since G measures B according to H, therefore G multiplied by H makes B. But, further, A multiplied by itself makes B, therefore the product of H and G equals the square on A.Therefore H is to A as A is to G.  But A measures G, therefore H also measures A, which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is absurd.Therefore D the greatest is not measured by any other number except A, B, or C.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is prime, then the greatest is not measured by any except those which have a place among the proportional numbers.

Therefore they measure F, which is less than A, which is impossible, for A is by hypothesis the least number measured by B, C, and D.Therefore no prime number measures A except B, C, and D.Therefore, if a number is the least that is measured by prime numbers, then it is not measured by any other prime number except those originally measuring it.

VLet A, B, and C, three numbers in continued proportion, be the least of those which have the same ratio with them.I say that the sum of any two of the numbers A, B, and C is relatively prime to the remaining number, that is, A plus B is relatively prime to C, B plus C is relatively prime to A, and A plus C is relatively prime to B.Take two numbers DE and EF to be the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, and C.It is then manifest that DE multiplied by itself makes A, and multiplied by EF makes B, and that EF multiplied by itself makes C.Now, since DE and EF are least, therefore they are relatively prime. But, if two numbers are relatively prime, then their sum is also relatively prime to each, therefore DF is relatively prime to each of the numbers DE and EF.But, further, DE is also relatively prime to EF, therefore DF and DE are relatively prime to EF. But, if two numbers are relatively prime to any number, then their product is also relatively prime to the other, so that the product of FD and DE is relatively prime to EF, hence the product of FD and DE is also relatively prime to the square on EF.But the product of FD and DE is the square on DE together with the product of DE and EF, therefore the sum of the square on DE and the product of DE and EF is relatively prime to the square on EF.And the square on DE is A, the product of DE and EF is B, and the square on EF is C, therefore the sum of A and B is prime to C.Similarly we can prove that the sum of B and C is relatively prime to A.I say next that the sum of A and C is also relatively prime to B.Since DF is relatively prime to each of the numbers DE and EF, therefore the square on DF is also relatively prime to the product of DE and EF.But the sum of the squares on DE and EF together with twice the product of DE and EF equals the square on DF, therefore the sum of the squares on DE and EF together with twice the product of DE and EF is relatively prime to the product of DE and EF.Taken separately, the sum of the squares on DE and EF together with the product of DE and EF is relatively prime to the product of DE and EF.Therefore, taken separately again, the sum of the squares on DE and EF is relatively prime to the product of DE and EF.And the square on DE is A, the product of DE and EF is B, and the square on EF is C.Therefore the sum of A and C is relatively prime to B.Therefore, if three numbers in continued proportion are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, then the sum of any two is relatively prime to the remaining number.

Therefore A measures B. And A is to B as B is to C. Therefore B also measures C, so that A also measures C.And since B is to C as C is to D, and B measures C, therefore C also measures D. But A measures C, so that A also measures D. But it also measures itself, therefore A measures A and D which are relatively prime, which is impossible.Therefore D is not to any other number as A is to B.Therefore, if there are as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are relatively prime, then the last is not to any other number as the first is to the second.

VLet A and B be the given two numbers. It is required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them.Now A and B are either relatively prime or not. And, if they are relatively prime, it was proved that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them.Next, let A and B not be relatively prime, and let B multiplied by itself make C. Then A either measures C or does not measure it.First, let it measure it according to D, therefore A multiplied by D makes C. But, further, B multiplied by itself makes C, therefore the product of A and D equals the square on B.Therefore A is to B as B is to D, therefore a third proportional number D has been found to A and B.Next, let A not measure C.I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number to A and B.If possible, let D be such third proportional. Then the product of A and D equals the square on B. But the square on B is C, therefore the product of A and D equals C.Hence A multiplied by D makes C, therefore A measures C according to D.But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it, which is absurd.Therefore it is not possible to find a third proportional number to A and B when A does not measure C.

Add the unit DF to DE.Then EF is either prime or not.First, let it be prime. Then the prime numbers A, B, C, and EF have been found which are more than A, B, and C.Next, let EF not be prime. Therefore it is measured by some prime number.  Let it be measured by the prime number G.I say that G is not the same with any of the numbers A, B, and C.If possible, let it be so. Now A, B, and C measure DE, therefore G also measures DE. But it also measures EF. Therefore G, being a number, measures the remainder, the unit DF, which is absurd.Therefore G is not the same with any one of the numbers A, B, and C. And by hypothesis it is prime. Therefore the prime numbers A, B, C, and G have been found which are more than the assigned multitude of A, B, and C.Therefore, prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

If not, we shall come upon a dyad, and A will be among those which are doubled from a dyad, which is contrary to the hypothesis.Thus A is even-times odd.But it was also proved even-times-even. Therefore A is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.Therefore, if an [even] number neither is one of those which is continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd, then it is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.

VLet there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, A, BC, D, and EF, beginning from A as least, and let there be subtracted from BC and EF the numbers BG and FH, each equal to A.I say that GC is to A as EH is to the sum of A, BC, and D.Make FK equal to BC, and FL equal to D.Then, since FK equals BC, and of these the part FH equals the part BG, therefore the remainder HK equals the remainder GC.And since EF is to D as D is to BC, and as BC is to A, while D equals FL, BC equals FK, and A equals FH, therefore EF is to FL as LF is to FK, and as FK is to FH. Taken separately EL is to LF as LK is to FK, and as KH is to FH.Since one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents is to the sum of the consequents, therefore KH is to FH as the sum of EL, LK, and KH is to the sum of LF, FK, and HF.But KH equals CG, FH equals A, and the sum of LF, FK, and HF equals the sum of D, BC, and A, therefore CG is to A as EH is to the sum of D, BC, and A.Therefore the excess of the second is to the first as the excess of the last is to the sum of those before it.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please are in continued proportion, and there is subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal to the first, then the excess of the second is to the first as the excess of the last is to the sum of all those before it.

VLet as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, and D, beginning from a unit be set out in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime, let E equal the sum, and let E multiplied by D make FG.I say that FG is perfect.For, however many A, B, C, and D are in multitude, take so many E, HK, L, and M in double proportion beginning from E.Therefore, ex aequali A is to D as E is to M. Therefore the product of E and D equals the product of A and M.  And the product of E and D is FG, therefore the product of A and M is also FG.Therefore A multiplied by M makes FG. Therefore M measures FG according to the units in A. And A is a dyad, therefore FG is double of M.But M, L, HK, and E are continuously double of each other, therefore E, HK, L, M, and FG are continuously proportional in double proportion.Subtract from the second HK and the last FG the numbers HN and FO, each equal to the first E. Therefore the excess of the second is to the first as the excess of the last is to the sum of those before it.  Therefore NK is to E as OG is to the sum of M, L, KH, and E.And NK equals E, therefore OG also equals M, L, HK, E. But FO also equals E, and E equals the sum of A, B, C, D and the unit. Therefore the whole FG equals the sum of E, HK, L, M, A, B, C, D, and the unit, and it is measured by them.I say also that FG is not measured by any other number except A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and the unit.If possible, let some number P measure FG, and let P not be the same with any of the numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, or M.And, as many times as P measures FG, so many units let there be in Q, therefore Q multiplied by P makes FG.But, further, E multiplied by D makes FG, therefore E is to Q as P is to D.And, since A, B, C, and D are continuously proportional beginning from a unit, therefore D is not measured by any other number except A, B, or C.And, by hypothesis, P is not the same with any of the numbers A, B, or C, therefore P does not measure D. But P is to D as E is to Q, therefore neither does E measure Q.And E is prime, and any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure.  Therefore E and Q are relatively prime.But primes are also least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, and E is to Q as P is to D, therefore E measures P the same number of times that Q measures D.But D is not measured by any other number except A, B, or C, therefore Q is the same with one of the numbers A, B, or C. Let it be the same with B.And, however many B, C, and D are in multitude, take so many E, HK, and L beginning from E.Now E, HK, and L are in the same ratio with B, C, and D, therefore, ex aequali B is to D as E is to L.Therefore the product of B and L equals the product of D and E.  But the product of D and E equals the product of Q and P, therefore the product of Q and P also equals the product of B and L.Therefore Q is to B as L is to P.  And Q is the same with B, therefore L is also the same with P, which is impossible, for by hypothesis P is not the same with any of the numbers set out.Therefore no number measures FG except A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and the unit.And FG was proved equal to the sum of A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and the unit, and a perfect number is that which equals its own parts,  therefore FG is perfect.Therefore, if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are set out continuously in double proportion until the sum of all becomes prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last makes some number, then the product is perfect.
